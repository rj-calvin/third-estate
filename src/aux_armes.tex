\scene

\open The H\^otel des Monnaies salon. In the midst of the variety of \patrons
that gather here are \paine and \brissot.

\startbrissot
Ah-h, you wouldn't get it - you're an American! And you refuse to learn French!
\stop

\stage Enter \sophie.

\startpaine
I'm just saying that capturing the Bastille doesn't have any strategic military
value.
\stop

\startsophie
\brissot. My husband should be down in a moment to meet you gentlemen.
\stop

\startbrissot
Ah, thank you, Madame.
\stop

\stage \sophie disengages.

\startpaine
You know, I'd guess \louis thought nothing of the news when it arrived to
Versailles.

Probably was more confused by it than anything.
\stop

\startbrissot
Ha, confused sounds about right!

That fat pig wouldn't know strategic value if it were handed to him by his
ministers.

\(beat)
And don't tell anyone I said that.
\stop

\startpaine
You must feel for the man. He can't always have his wife around to whip him
into shape.
\stop

\stage \brissot stifles a chuckle.

\startbrissot
Don't go around saying that.
\stop

\startpaine
Why not? I won't be speaking it in French.
\stop

\startbrissot
Don't pretend you have a monopoly on English. Gossip travels quick, and it is
often keen on abstracting away the details that absolve you.

I'd prefer that you not be thought of as belonging with fools like \marat.
\stop

\startpaine
Don't insult me! I will not be accused of associating with that charlatan.
\stop

\startbrissot
Perhaps you don't understand: we French understand gossip as a form of art.

The words of gossip compose stories woven by the beating heart of our beautiful
nation.

\(beat)
To put it simply, your technique needs work.

At the moment, you are as talentless as \marat, indeed!
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startpaine
That's nonsense. Gossip is conspiracy!

In America, we simply say what we see, and when I see a king clearly whipped by
his queen, I'll damn well say it if I please!
\stop

\startbrissot
You should heed my advice.
\stop

\startsplit

\startpaine
Advice? I'll have no advice from a hypocrite. You accuse the king of
incompetency, / yet I am decried for a joke at his expense?
\stop

\split
\leavevmode

\startbrissot
I asked you to not repeat that.
\stop

\stopsplit

\startbrissot
But, yes. This is true.
\stop

\startpaine
You even laughed!
\stop

\startbrissot
I laughed because I agreed with you, but now is not the time to agree on such
matter.

As of now, only the most brutish and ignorant politicians accuse poor
Antoinette of treachery.

Instead, if one's goal is to form a republic, it would be more advantageous for
them to seed suspicion of the king's idiocy.
\stop

\startpaine
But queen Antoinette is Austrian, it's obvious that hostility would result in a
conflict of incentives.

I mean, she's emperor Leopold's sister for christ's sake.
\stop

\startbrissot
Worse than that, she associates herself with the \'emigr\'es.
\stop

\startpaine
The who?
\stop

\startbrissot
The emigrants who fled France to join Austria against the revolution.
\stop

\startpaine
Oh, like what \louis is doing now?
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
I cannot believe that man would do something so stupid.
\stop

\startpaine
Has he been found?
\stop

\startbrissot
He has. He should be arriving back to the Tuileries later tonight, actually.

You can go see him if you'd like.
\stop

\startpaine
Me? You won't be going?
\stop

\startbrissot
No. I'd be crushed under the weight of his embarrassment.

How has a man who has lived his whole life surrounded by politics not learned a
single thing about strategy in that time?

Absolutely pathetic.
\stop

\startpaine
What does \condorcet think?
\stop

\startbrissot
About the king's flight? He's convinced that it's the biggest thing since
Luther.
\stop

\startpaine
I didn't know \condorcet was a protestant. I myself was raised as a Quaker.
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh, he isn't. Don't accuse him of that.

\(beat)
He's actually an atheist, but don't tell anyone that - that's sensitive gossip.

Though, that's not to imply that he wouldn't enjoy a good theological
discussion.
\stop

\startpaine
So, by the biggest thing since Luther, how do you mean?
\stop

\stage \brissot smiles and shakes his head.

\startbrissot
He's bound to create a lot enemies if he isn't careful - particularly with
people he calls friends.
\stop

\startpaine
How so?
\stop

\startbrissot
Tensions are very high.

Word is that \barnave was one of the delegates of the assembly chosen to go
fetch the king.

My guess is that Antoinette is going to try something on him, maybe "convince"
him that \louis remains unflinchingly loyal to the constitution that he just
spat on.

\(disbelief)
The man deliberately leaves a tell-all letter confessing that the oath he took
last year in front of god and country was done through seething teeth.

Can you believe that?
\stop

\startpaine
To be fair, I'm sure that's how all kings should be expected to feel about
revolutions.
\stop

\startbrissot
Can you really believe he left a {\underbar confession} on his desk? What an
imbecile!
\stop

\startpaine
I suppose I can believe it, if you're so keen on having an answer.
\stop

\startbrissot
\(deep breath)
The way I see things, if it happens that \barnave comes back "convinced" of
the king's patriotism, then I expect that he and \lafayette will have the
assembly bent on maintaining the monarchy.

By force if need be.

\(beat)
It's certainly a dangerous time to be \condorcet right now.
\stop

\startpaine
\(chuckles)
I like the sound of him.
\stop

\startbrissot
\(chuckles)
God help the man.
\stop

\startpaine
So, how is it that you know him?
\stop

\startbrissot
He and I are outspoken abolitionists. We're both members of the society of
friends of the blacks.
\stop

\startpaine
Oh, similar to --
\stop

\startbrissot
-- To the one in London, yes! I formed the society myself after being inspired
during my time there.

\(beat)
Did you know that in Saint-Domingue it's not uncommon for slave owners to gouge
out the eyes of their house slaves so they can churn butter "without
distractions?"
\stop

\startpaine
As a matter of fact, I've heard that about American slave owners.

Truth be told, I don't need gossip to feel disgusted by slavery.
\stop

\stage \brissot pats \paine's arm: good man!

\startpaine[continued]
For me, it's simply a matter of reasoning.
\stop

\startbrissot
Ha! That's what \condorcet keeps telling me, too.
\stop

\startpaine
But you don't agree?
\stop

\startbrissot
Not when it fails to win support.
\stop

\startpaine
Though, it must still be an asset to have a philosopher as a colleague.
\stop

\stage \brissot checks for where \sophie is.

\startbrissot
It would hurt his feelings to say this, but \condorcet may happen to be the
least talented politician I have ever met.
\stop

\startpaine
You'd slander your ally?
\stop

\startbrissot
I mean, if you consider honesty to be slander.

If, by honesty, you think of filth like \marat.

Or the crude such as yourself - oh, pardon me!
\stop

\stage \paine is humored.

\startbrissot[continued]
The truth is, I keep \condorcet close because his honesty keeps me sane.
\stop

\direction An infant can be heard crying from the other room.

\stage Enter \condorcet.

\startdrunkard
Wa-a-ah! Wa-a-a-a-ah!
\stop

\stage A few \patrons laugh. \sophie sneers at the \drunkard.

\stage \brissot stands to make a scene.

\startbrissot
Who's this insufferable bastard?

You dare call yourself a patriot?

Do not mock this daughter of the revolution!

Is your heart so closed to sympathy that you cannot tell that her cries are
sincere?

\(brief chuckle)
She cries because she begs for the freedom that's been taken from her!

By the betrayal of her once trusted father, no less!

And what a tragedy it is that this little patriot does not yet know that
tomorrow must always arrive, thus she grieves that her torment shall last for
eternity.
\stop

\stage Laughter.

\direction The infant cries louder.

\startbrissot[continued]
Oh! To weep alone and anxious, wondering if one's life will ever feel the joys
of liberty and freedom again - ah, my heart bleeds for her!

We should all be so lucky to have a voice shrill enough to cry with her.

Surely, together, we would pierce all the ears in France!
\stop

\stage Laughter.

\startbrissot[continued]
You laugh, yet you hear her, do you not? You cowards!

You hear her cry but refuse to hear her plea!

She cries for us! To come to her liberation - free her from her Bastille! To
fight for her soul and the abolishment of bedtimes! To arms! To arms!
\stop

\startdrunkard
To arms! To arms!
\stop

\stage Laughter.

\stage \sophie punches \brissot in the arm.

\stage Exit \sophie.

\startcondorcet
Ah! Alas, my villainy has been exposed by the great journalist, \brissot!
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
Thank you, friend, thank you. Your honesty always reveals the deepest
kindnesses.
\stop

\startcondorcet
\(to \paine)
And friends indeed: you are American!
\stop

\startpaine
What gave me away?
\stop

\startcondorcet
\sophie had mentioned.
\stop

\startbrissot
This, \condorcet, is my latest friend from America, \paine[formal].

You two are certain to get along.
\stop

\startpaine
I brought a letter of introduction.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Oh, from Jefferson?
\stop

\startpaine
Franklin.
\stop

\stage \condorcet gasps and takes the letter.

\startcondorcet
My word, he had died just last year!
\stop

\stage \condorcet brushes past \paine to sit and read. \brissot smiles and
invites \paine to join him.

\stage Pause.

\stage \condorcet is quietly enjoying his time reading.

\startpaine
\(chuckles)
You were right, \brissot. He and I are going to get along wonderfully.
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\stage \condorcet shakes \paine's hand and returns the letter.

\startcondorcet
Pleasure, Monsieur \paine.

\(claps his hands)
So! What schemes are we up to tonight? How shall we establish the first
republic of France!
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh, you say it so loudly...
\stop

\startpaine
We should start by creating new journal.

We'll call it "Le Republican."
\stop

\startsplit

\startcondorcet
A wonderful idea!
\stop

\split

\startbrissot
Oh, lord...
\stop

\stopsplit

\startcondorcet
Though, calling it "Le R\'epublicaine," will give the impression that it's a
publication written by women.
\stop

\startbrissot
Listen, \condorcet\ --
\stop

\startcondorcet
-- Wait, that's actually ingenious!

This way we can further the cause for both republicanism {\underbar and} the
rights of women at the same time!

We should let \sophie know.

She and her friends would love to contribute, I'm sure.

\(beat)
As for me, my thinking is that the primary cause for concern among patriots
regarding republicanism is their confusion about its strengths.

So I'm preparing a speech to give to the \jacobins club to appeal to the public
reason.
\stop

\startsplit

\startpaine
And we can have pamphlets and posters printed with your name on it!
\stop

\split
\leavevmode

\startbrissot
\paine[informal]...
\stop

\stopsplit

\startcondorcet
True! My name is very well known for my role at the Academy.

It would certainly help improve turnout.
\stop

\startbrissot
Enough!
\stop

\stage \paine laughs.

\startcondorcet
What's this?
\stop

\startbrissot
The climate is still very hostile to republicanism. We must be strategic if we
are going to proceed.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Be strategic? Why should we obfuscate what is obvious to everyone?

\louis has effectively shattered his own crown!
\stop

\startbrissot
\barnave has me worried. As well as \lafayette, though less so.
\stop

\startpaine
What's so wrong with \lafayette?
\stop

\startbrissot
\(chuckles)
Right now, he's a little puppy who knows it shat the bed.

His reputation has been damaged, he looks like a fool, and he's likely
motivated to reclaim his "honor," or what have you.
\stop

\startpaine
There doesn't seem any wrong with that.
\stop

\startcondorcet
I agree, I think there's still hope for him to free himself of all those
intriguers that he keeps surrounding himself with.
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
That poor boy thinks he's playing a big game like he's not the one being
dragged around on a leash.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Don't be so harsh, he and I have long been friends.

Just a few days ago, I heard him talking about his hatred of kings.

He'll come around.
\stop

\startbrissot
I think you're going to be surprised.
\stop

\stage Enter \sophie.

\startcondorcet
Ah! \sophie! What are your thoughts on starting a new journal to advocate for
the republic?
\stop

\startsophie
Oh, that's a wonderful idea!
\stop

\startcondorcet
I agree! We were thinking of calling it "Le R\'epublicaine" in order to support
both republicanism and the rights of women.
\stop

\startsophie
Oh - oh, no. That's ridiculous.
\stop

\startcondorcet
What?
\stop

\startsophie
\condorcet[personal], I love you, but that's a terrible idea. Nobody would read
it.
\stop

\startcondorcet
You think so?
\stop

\startsplit

\startsophie
Yes. I'm sorry, my dear.
\stop

\split

\startbrissot
It's true.
\stop

\stopsplit

\startbrissot[continued]
But even if you named it properly, I'm still worried that you're going to be
thought of as associated with \marat and the other radicals.
\stop

\startcondorcet
\marat is calling for a republic, too?
\stop

\startbrissot
Of course he is.
\stop

\startcondorcet
What's next? Elections via animal magnetism?
\stop

\stage \paine and \condorcet laugh.

\startbrissot
Listen... at the time, animal magnetism sounded very groundbreaking.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Which is one reason why education is so essential!
\stop

\startbrissot
True, which is why you should stick to your speech if you're so insistent.

\(beat)
A calm, tranquil speech from a philosopher would help lift the stigma of the
word "republican."

But a journal would only invite ridicule from the royalists.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Ha! If it's bullies that have you afraid, I shall tell you that I am no
stranger.

As a boy, my mother forbade me from wearing my breeches until I had reached the
age of nine.

I assure you that the cruelty of child-like minds are not a burden to me.
\stop

\stage \paine and \brissot stifle their laughter. \sophie punches each in the
arm.

\startsophie
Oh, and on the matter of speeches...
\stop

\stage \sophie punches \brissot in the arm.

\startsophie[continued]
Why did you have to wake my daughter up with that speech?
\stop

\startbrissot
I apologize! I apologize. I must have been struck by whatever spirit possesses
\danton.

Perhaps it's a disease that has started to spread.
\stop

\startcondorcet
I've never really known you as someone who improvises their speeches.
\stop

\startbrissot
Fair... Alright, I like you all well enough to speak freely.

I actually paid the \drunkard over there before we arrived.
\stop

% TODO: add support for using macros in the cue parameter.
\startdialog[cue={All}]
What?

\startsplit

\startcondorcet
So much effort for a laugh?
\stopcondorcet

\split

\startsophie
You paid someone to help you annoy my child?
\stop

\stopsplit

\startpaine
Ah-h! I understand.
\stop

\startbrissot
Very astute. We may make a proper Frenchman of you yet, \paine[informal].

You see, if you really want to get rid of the king, you're going to need more
subtlety.

And, how's the saying? All the world's a stage?
\stop

\stage \brissot clears his throat and stands. The \patrons turn to look at him.

\startbrissot
TO ARMS! TO ARMS!
\stop

\startpatrons
TO ARMS! TO ARMS!

\stage Laughter.
