\scene

\open The H\^otel des Monnaies salon. In the midst of the variety of \patrons
are \paine and \brissot engaged in a conversation.

\startbrissot
Ah-h, you wouldn't get it - you're an American! And you refuse to learn French!
\stop

\startpaine
I'm just saying that, militarily, capturing the Bastille had little strategic
value.
\stop

\startbrissot
Strategic value! Strategic value? What's this value have anything to do with
the strength of our hearts and minds?
\stop

\startpaine
If it's only hearts and minds, a pamphlet would have sufficed.
\stop

\startbrissot
Gah! A pamphlet? You think we haven't thought of trying that?

Oh, god, if only it were that easy when your slaver is the one who chooses the
price of bread.
\stop

\startpaine
Your slaver? You'd compare yourself to the poor lads in Saint-Domingue?
\stop

\startbrissot
Is that not the language to use for anyone who is not free?

Perhaps, to you, freedom means the right to go about your day,
business-as-usual.

No. We fight here in Paris for our very way of life - for the natural rights
that must be pried from the iron claws of an ancient regime!
\stop

\startpaine
But who are you fighting? \louis has abdicated his throne. All you need to do
is declare a republic.
\stop

\startbrissot
Gah! If only it were that easy...
\stop

\startpaine
Mm, a republic isn't exactly common sense here in Paris, is it?
\stop

\startbrissot
Common sense? Merely the act of speaking the word could have you arrested.

\(beat)
The Paris commune is very eager to "make an example" of anyone who might wish
to "subvert the constitution."
\stop

\startpaine
What constitution? The National Assembly wrote the whole thing for a king who
shattered his own crown just a few days ago.
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
Oh. Didn't you hear?

Our idiot-king was found in Varennes. In fact, he should be arriving back to
the Tuileries later tonight.

You could go and see him if you don't mind being crushed under the weight of
his shame.
\stop

\startpaine
I don't see how this changes anything. This was clearly an act of treason.
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh, indeed it was. Absolutely \underbar{indisputable} proof that all the
conspiracies of him and Antoinette colluding with Austria were true.

\(beat)
Oh, and let's not forgot the damned \underbar{confession} the moron left for
us!

Yes, the letter that that puts in no uncertain terms how he \underbar{truly}
feels about the revolution.

How he swore his oath to the rights of man through gritted teeth and bitter
hatred in his heart.

If only this was enough to eliminate people's prejudices!
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startbrissot[continued]
But what I can't stand most is the incompetency of it all. How clumsy the
charade is. How shameless and cowardly he acts.

\(beat)
I hate it. I hate it more than you can know.

Because it means that our true enemy... is our own idleness.
\stop

\stage Enter \sophie.

\startsophie
\condorcet is putting our daughter to sleep, he'll be down shortly.
\stop

\startbrissot
\(deep breath)
Excellent news, madame.
\stop

\stage \sophie sits with the two as a peer.

\startpaine
So, how is it that you know \condorcet?
\stop

\startsophie
He's my husband, silly!
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh, how I know him?

He and I met through the society of friends of the blacks, an association
that I formed around the time of the Estates-General.
\stop

\startpaine
Much like the, uh --
\stop

\startbrissot
-- Like the one in London, yes! I was very inspired during my trip a few years
ago.

\(hushed)
Did you know that it's custom for slavers in Saint-Domingue to gouge out the
eyes of their house slaves so that they can churn butter "without
distractions?"
\stop

\startsplit

\startsophie
Ugh! Don't bring up such morbid --
\stop

\split
\vskip\bigskipamount

\startpaine
-- As a matter of fact, I've heard that about American slavers.
\stop

\stopsplit

\startpaine[continued]
I don't make my mind up based on rumors. My disgust for slavery is justified by
simple reasoning.
\stop

\startbrissot
Ha! \condorcet keeps trying to tell me the same thing.
\stop

\startpaine
You don't agree that it's simple reasoning?
\stop

\startbrissot
I don't agree that reason is how you gain support for a cause.
\stop

\startpaine
Then how do you go about it?
\stop

\startbrissot
Showmanship.
\stop

\startsophie
I'm sure charlatans like \marat would agree with you.
\stop

\startbrissot
\marat is a maniac who appeals to the most savage prejudices in men.

What he agrees or doesn't agree with means nothing to me anymore. Nor should it
to anyone!

\(beat)
Proper showmanship only requires proper knowledge of one's audience.

So, yes, it's true: \marat is a capable showman~- and that's because he's
honest and a crowd seeks honest men.

But honesty is ugly: it pollutes the world with archaic rituals and revolting
prejudices.

And his crowd is as filthy as the heart that feeds on them.

\(gestures)
I, however... cultivate a finer audience.
\stop

\startpaine
Is that why you partnered with a philosopher?
\stop

\startbrissot
Partner might be putting it strongly. \condorcet is a friend.
\stop

\startpaine
Do the two of you disagree often?
\stop

\startbrissot
No. But I see him as a liability in politics.
\stop

\startsophie
A liability? Excuse me?
\stop

\startbrissot
Madame, you must admit that your husband is a brilliant man, but a terrible
politician.
\stop

\stage \sophie is conflicted.

\startpaine
Do not be rude to our lovely hostess, \brissot.
\stop

\startbrissot
You're right, \paine[thomas]. I apologize for my forwardness, madame, but I
must also ask that you don't mistake my criticism for hatred.

I consider my relationship with \condorcet to be deeply valuable.

\(beat)
The truth is, of all the honest men in Paris, his honesty is the only one that
keeps me sane.
\stop

\direction An infant can be heard crying from the other room.

\stage Enter \condorcet.

\startdrunkard
Wa-a-ah! Wa-a-a-a-ah!
\stop

\stage A few \patrons laugh. \sophie sneers at the \drunkard.

\stage \brissot stands to make a scene.

\startbrissot
Who's this insufferable bastard?

You dare call yourself a patriot?

Is your heart so closed to sympathy that you cannot tell that her cries are
sincere?

\(chuckles)
She cries because she begs for the freedom that's been taken from her~-
entrapped, then abandoned by her own father, no less!

Oh, and such a tragedy it is that this little patriot does not yet know that
tomorrow must always arrive, thus she grieves that her torment shall last for
eternity.
\stop

\stage The \patrons laugh.

\direction The infant cries louder.

\startbrissot[continued]
Oh! To weep alone and anxious, wondering if one's life will ever feel the joys
of liberty again - ah, my heart bleeds for her!

We should all be so lucky to have a voice shrill enough to cry with her.

Surely, together, we would pierce all the ears in France!
\stop

\stage The \patrons laugh.

\startbrissot[continued]
You laugh, yet you hear her, do you not? You cowards!

You hear her cry but refuse to hear her plea!

She cries for us! To come to her liberation - free her from her Bastille! To
fight for her soul and the abolishment of bedtimes! TO ARMS! TO ARMS!
\stop

\startdrunkard
To arms! To arms!
\stop

\stage Laughter from the \patrons, followed by applause.

\stage \sophie punches \brissot in the arm.

\stage Exit \sophie.

\startcondorcet
Alas, my villainy has been exposed by the vigilant journalism from \brissot!
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
Thank you, friend, thank you.
\stop

% \startcondorcet
% \(to \paine)
% And friends indeed: you are American!
% \stop
%
% \startpaine
% What gave me away?
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% \sophie had mentioned.
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% This, \condorcet, is my latest friend from America, \paine[formal].
%
% You two are certain to get along.
% \stop
%
% \startpaine
% I brought a letter of introduction.
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% Oh, from Jefferson?
% \stop
%
% \startpaine
% Franklin.
% \stop
%
% \stage \condorcet gasps and takes the letter.
%
% \startcondorcet
% My word, he had died just last year!
% \stop
%
% \stage \condorcet brushes past \paine to sit and read. \brissot smiles and
% invites \paine to join him.
%
% \stage Pause.
%
% \stage \condorcet is quietly enjoying his time reading.
%
% \startpaine
% \(chuckles)
% You were right, \brissot. He and I are going to get along wonderfully.
% \stop
%
% \stage \brissot laughs.
%
% \stage \condorcet shakes \paine's hand and returns the letter.
%
% \startcondorcet
% Pleasure, Monsieur \paine.
%
% \(claps his hands)
% So! What schemes are we up to tonight? How shall we establish the first
% republic of France!
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% Oh, you say it so loudly...
% \stop
%
% \startpaine
% We should start by creating new journal.
%
% We'll call it "Le R\'epublicain."
% \stop
%
% \startsplit

% \startcondorcet

%
% It would certainly help improve turnout.
% \stop

% \startbrissot
% Enough!
% \stop
%
% \stage \paine laughs.
%
% \startcondorcet
% What's this?
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% The climate is still very hostile to republicanism. We must be strategic if we
% are going to proceed.
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% Be strategic? Why should we obfuscate what is obvious to everyone?
%
% King \louis[royal] has effectively shattered his own crown!
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% \barnave has me worried. As well as \lafayette, though less so.
% \stop
%
% \startpaine
% What's so wrong with \lafayette?
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% \(chuckles)
% Right now, he's a little puppy who knows it shat the bed.
%
% His reputation has been damaged, he looks like a fool, and he's likely
% motivated to reclaim his "honor," or what have you.
% \stop
%
% \startpaine
% There doesn't seem any wrong with that.
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% I agree, I think there's still hope for him to free himself of all those
% intriguers that he keeps surrounding himself with.
% \stop
%

% \startbrissot
% That poor boy thinks he's playing a big game like he's not the one being
% dragged around on a leash.
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% Don't be so harsh, he and I have long been friends.
%
% He'll come around.
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% I think you'd be surprised.
% \stop
%
% \stage Enter \sophie.
%
% \startcondorcet
% Ah! \sophie! Join us!
%
% What are your thoughts on starting a new journal to advocate for the republic?
% \stop
%
% \startsophie
% Oh, that's a wonderful idea!
%
% I could talk with Olympe. She'd love to contribute, I'm sure.
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% Or Madame Roland.
% \stop
%
% \startsophie
% Oh, ahem. I'm not so sure.
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% About Roland, oh, do tell!
% \stop
%
% \startsophie
% She's just... snobby. I detest it.
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% Well, anyhow, it's no matter. The point is nil.
%
% Right now, \marat is dominating the rhetoric on republicanism, so any talk of
% forming a republic will create suspicion of being one of his "sans-culottes."
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% \marat is calling for a republic, too?
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% Of course he is.
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% What's next? Elections via animal magnetism?
% \stop
%
% \stage \paine and \condorcet laugh.
%
% \startbrissot
% Listen... at the time, animal magnetism sounded very groundbreaking.
% \stop
%
% \startcondorcet
% Which is one reason why education is so essential!
% \stop
%
% \startbrissot
% True, which is why you should stick to your speech if you're so insistent.
%
% \(beat)
% A calm, tranquil speech from a philosopher would help lift the stigma of the
