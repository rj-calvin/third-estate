\scene

\open The H\^otel des Monnaies salon. In the midst of the variety of \patrons
are \paine and \brissot engaged in a conversation.

\startbrissot
Ah-h, you wouldn't get it - you're an American! And you refuse to learn French!
\stop

\startpaine
I'm just saying that, militarily, capturing the Bastille had little strategic
value.
\stop

\startbrissot
Strategic value! Strategic value? What's this value have anything to do with
the strength of our hearts and minds?
\stop

\startpaine
If it's only hearts and minds, a pamphlet would have sufficed.
\stop

\startbrissot
Gah! A pamphlet? You think we haven't thought of trying that?

Oh, god, if only it were that easy when your slaver is the one who chooses the
price of bread.
\stop

\startpaine
Your slaver? You'd compare yourself to the poor lads in Saint-Domingue?
\stop

\startbrissot
Is that not the language to use for anyone who is not free?

Perhaps, to you, freedom means the right to go about your day,
business-as-usual.

No. We fight here in Paris for our very way of life - for the natural rights
that must be pried from the iron claws of an ancient regime!
\stop

\startpaine
But who are you fighting? \louis has abdicated his throne. All you need to do
is declare a republic.
\stop

\startbrissot
Gah! If only it were that easy...
\stop

\startpaine
Mm, a republic isn't exactly common sense here in Paris, is it?
\stop

\startbrissot
Common sense? Merely the act of speaking the word could have you arrested.

\(beat)
The Paris commune is very eager to "make an example" of anyone who might wish
to "subvert the constitution."
\stop

\startpaine
What constitution? The National Assembly wrote the whole thing for a king who
shattered his own crown just a few days ago.
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
Oh. Didn't you hear?

Our idiot-king was found in Varennes. In fact, he should be arriving back to
the Tuileries later tonight.

You could go and see him if you don't mind being crushed under the weight of
his shame.
\stop

\startpaine
I don't see how this changes anything. This was clearly an act of treason.
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh, indeed it was. Absolutely \underbar{indisputable} proof that all the
conspiracies of him and Antoinette colluding with Austria were true.

\(beat)
Oh, and let's not forgot the damned \underbar{confession} the moron left for
us!

Yes, the letter that that puts in no uncertain terms how he truly feels about
the revolution.

How he swore his oath to the rights of man through gritted teeth and bitter
hatred in his heart.

If only this was enough to eliminate people's prejudices!
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startbrissot[continued]
But what I can't stand most is the incompetency of it all. How clumsy the
charade is. How shameless and cowardly he acts.
\stop

\stage Enter \sophie.

\startbrissot[continued]
I hate it. I hate it more than you can know.

Because it means that our true enemy... is our own idleness.
\stop

\startsophie
\condorcet is putting our daughter to sleep, he'll be down shortly.
\stop

\startbrissot
\(deep breath)
Excellent news, madame.
\stop

\stage \sophie sits with the two as a peer.

\startpaine
So, how is it that you know \condorcet?
\stop

\startsophie
He's my husband, silly!
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh, how I know him?

He and I met through the society of friends of the blacks, an association
that I formed around the time of the Estates-General.
\stop

\startpaine
Much like the, uh --
\stop

\startbrissot
-- Like the one in London, yes! I was very inspired during my trip a few years
ago.

\(hushed)
Did you know that it's custom for slavers in Saint-Domingue to gouge out the
eyes of their house slaves so that they can churn butter "without
distractions?"
\stop

\startsplit

\startsophie
Ugh! Don't bring up such morbid --
\stop

\split
\vskip\bigskipamount

\startpaine
-- As a matter of fact, I've heard that about American slavers.
\stop

\stopsplit

\startpaine[continued]
I don't make my mind up based on rumors. My disgust for slavery is justified by
simple reasoning.
\stop

\startbrissot
Ha! \condorcet keeps trying to tell me the same thing.
\stop

\startpaine
You don't agree that it's simple reasoning?
\stop

\startbrissot
I don't agree that reason is how you gain support for a cause.
\stop

\startpaine
Then how do you go about it?
\stop

\startbrissot
Showmanship.
\stop

\startsophie
I'm sure charlatans like \marat would agree with you.
\stop

\startbrissot
\marat is a maniac who appeals to the most savage prejudices in men.

What he agrees or doesn't agree with means nothing to me anymore. Nor should it
to anyone!

\(beat)
Proper showmanship only requires proper knowledge of one's audience.

So, yes, it's true: \marat is a capable showman~- and that's because he's
honest and a crowd seeks honest men.

But honesty is ugly: it pollutes the world with archaic rituals and revolting
prejudices.

And his crowd is as filthy as the heart that feeds on them.

\(gestures)
I, however... cultivate a finer audience.
\stop

\startpaine
Is that why you partnered with a philosopher?
\stop

\startbrissot
Partner might be putting it strongly. \condorcet is a friend.
\stop

\startpaine
Do the two of you disagree often?
\stop

\startbrissot
No. But I see him as a liability in politics.
\stop

\startsophie
A liability? Excuse me?
\stop

\startbrissot
Madame, you must admit that your husband is a brilliant man, but a terrible
politician.
\stop

\stage \sophie is conflicted.

\startpaine
Don't be rude to our lovely hostess, \brissot.
\stop

\startbrissot
You're right, \paine[thomas]. I apologize for my forwardness, madame, but I
must also ask that you don't mistake my criticism for hatred.

I consider my relationship with \condorcet to be deeply valuable.

\(to \paine)
The truth is, of all the honest men in Paris, his honesty is the only one that
keeps me sane.
\stop

\direction An infant can be heard crying from the other room.

\stage Enter \condorcet.

\startdrunkard
Wa-a-ah! Wa-a-a-a-ah!
\stop

\stage A few \patrons laugh. \sophie sneers at the \drunkard.

\stage \brissot stands to make a scene.

\startbrissot
Who's this insufferable bastard?

You dare call yourself a patriot?

Is your heart so closed to sympathy that you cannot tell that her cries are
sincere?

\(chuckles)
She cries because she begs for the freedom that's been taken from her~-
entrapped, then abandoned by her own father, no less!

Oh, and such a tragedy it is that this little patriot does not yet know that
tomorrow must always arrive, thus she grieves that her torment shall last for
eternity.
\stop

\stage The \patrons laugh.

\direction The infant cries louder.

\startbrissot[continued]
Oh! To weep alone and anxious, wondering if one's life will ever feel the joys
of liberty again - ah, my heart bleeds for her!

We should all be so lucky to have a voice shrill enough to cry with her.

Surely, together, we would pierce all the ears in France!
\stop

\stage The \patrons laugh.

\startbrissot[continued]
You laugh, yet you hear her, do you not? You cowards!

You hear her cry but refuse to hear her plea!

She cries for us! To come to her liberation - free her from her Bastille! To
fight for her soul and the abolishment of bedtimes! TO ARMS! TO ARMS!
\stop

\startdrunkard
To arms! To arms!
\stop

\stage Laughter from the \patrons, followed by applause.

\stage \sophie punches \brissot in the arm.

\stage Exit \sophie.

\startcondorcet
ALAS, my villainy has been exposed by the vigilant journalism from \brissot!
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\direction The infant quiets down.

\startbrissot
Thank you, friend, thank you. Your honesty always reveals the deepest
kindnesses.

\(beat)
Now, let us join our new friend from America! Mister \paine[full].
\stop

\startpaine
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
\stop

\stage \paine hands \condorcet a letter. \condorcet doesn't pay much mind to
it.

\startcondorcet
You've been to Paris before, haven't you?
\stop

\startbrissot
I am certain you two will get along.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Oh, will I be talking his ear off?
\stop

\startbrissot
Yes.
\stop

\stage \condorcet seems giddy.

\startpaine
\(clears throat)
Yes, I was the one who joined Colonel Laurens ten years ago when we were
raising funds for the war with Charles.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Ah, yes, that's right! And how is Franklin doing?
\stop

\startpaine
Franklin passed away shortly after I departed for Europe, sadly.
\stop

\stage \condorcet is shocked!

\startpaine[continued]
Not long after writing my letter of introduction, in fact.
\stop

\stage \condorcet snaps from a stupor to feverishly read the letter.

\startpaine[continued]
\(to \brissot)
You're right. He and I are going to get along just fine.
\stop

\stage \condorcet seems moved.

\startcondorcet
Oh, well met, mister \paine.

A philosopher from America is of great need if France is going to follow in the
footsteps of the American republic!
\stop

\stage Enter \sophie.

\startcondorcet[continued]
\sophie! Oh, \sophie! I have dire news!
\stop

\stage \sophie seems defensive.

\startcondorcet[continued]
Franklin has passed!
\stop

\stage \condorcet hands her the letter.

\startsophie
Oh, is this from Franklin?
\stop

\stage \sophie begins reading.

\startcondorcet
It was the last letter that he wrote...
\stop

\startpaine
I... doubt that's true...
\stop

\startsophie
Hm. Well... well, he certainly writes favorably of mister \paine, I suppose.
\stop

\startpaine
I'm flattered, but this was only a matter of --
\stop

\startcondorcet
\(to \sophie)
-- Are you disappointed?
\stop

\startsophie
Oh, no, I don't wish to be impolite!
\stop

\startcondorcet
Oh, hush! We are all enlightened people, so there should be no fear to discuss
honestly with one another the interesting nuances of emotion.

\(to \brissot and \paine)
Wouldn't you agree?
\stop

\stage \brissot gestures as if to object~--

\startsophie
-- You're right. Indeed, I don't quite know how to label the feeling, so it
would help to discuss it.
\stop

\stage \condorcet seems delighted!

\startsophie[continued]
Of course, I respect Franklin based on his writing, but I never knew him
personally like you have, \condorcet[c].
\stop

\stage \condorcet seems eager to speak, but \sophie gestures, then smiles.

\startsophie
So, I believe that I... I felt pressured to be as sad about his passing as you
seemed to be.

I felt... defensive... or, no... I felt \underbar{protective} of my feelings,
as if...
\stop

\startcondorcet
Perhaps, if I understand correctly, that you felt like I was attempting to
modify your relationship with Franklin?
\stop

\startsophie
Yes! It felt as if you insisted that I should feel the same way that you do,
and I felt protective because I cherish all relationships that I form with
others~--
\stop

\startsplit

\startsophie[continued]
-- no matter the form they take!
\stop

\split

\startcondorcet
-- no matter the form they take!
\stop

\stopsplit

\startcondorcet[continued]
Eureka!
\stop

\startpaine
Why does the form of the relationship matter in the first place?
\stop

\startsophie
Well. I believe that the relationships we form through writing are different
than the relationships we form through speaking.
\stop

\startpaine
I don't feel that way.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startsophie
Well. Why not?
\stop

\startpaine
Because words have the same meaning whether they are heard or read, do they
not?
\stop

\startsophie
No. No. I don't think so.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Ah! I think I understand the issue! Our minds are constructed of exactly two
hemispheres in dialogue with one another!
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startcondorcet[continued]
Oh. Uhm.

\(clears throat)
Uh, what was I thinking?

Ah! Consider if only one hemisphere is necessary to produce the language we
speak, and the other to produce the language we write, then the hemispheres
will interpret the other as distinct and therefore form a relationship with
the other.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startcondorcet[continued]
Uh. Uh. Hm.

\(beat)
Ah! And as \sophie has just taught us, because this relationship is our most
treasured of all relationships, our instinct to protect this relationship is,
therefore, the most intense of all.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startpaine
But what does this have to do with our disagreement?
\stop

\startcondorcet
What? What disagreement?
\stop

\startbrissot
Didn't I say that you two would get along wonderfully?
\stop

\startpaine
Not exactly what I had in mind.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Oh. Yes. I understand. No, I do have a habit of getting lost in my thoughts, so
- if I understand you, \brissot~- you mean that \paine is someone who can help
keep me from building - how does \danton put it? - "bloodless abstractions?"
\stop

\stage \brissot smiles.

\startbrissot
Yes.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Wonderful! An excellent combination!
\stop

\startpaine
And this combination is to happen without my consent?
\stop

\startcondorcet
Well, you came to make a good impression, correct?

As \brissot has taught me, this changes how a man behaves.

\(beat)
Uh, meaning that you are more amenable to provide favors.
\stop

\startbrissot
PERHAPS, the politics of our personal relationships has overstayed its welcome.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startcondorcet
So, uh, \paine[thomas]~- what do you think France should do with her king?
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh, my lord in heaven.
\stop

\startpaine
Exile.
\stop

\startbrissot
Exile? Unacceptable! He would immediately go to Austria and unite the
emigrants!
\stop

\startpaine
The who?
\stop

\startcondorcet
The people who fled from the revolution to Austria.
\stop

\startpaine
Oh, like what \louis is doing now?
\stop

\stage \condorcet laughs!

\startbrissot
What he attempted to do.
\stop

\startpaine
So, what then? Confinement?
\stop

\startbrissot
HA! No.
\stop

\startcondorcet
\brissot, speak plainly.
\stop

\stage \brissot suddenly seems nervous of his surroundings.

\startbrissot
If you swear on your lives that you won't share this information with others?
\stop

\stage All nod. \brissot leans in - glances at \sophie~- then hesitates
before~--

\startbrissot
\(hushed)
-- The truth is, I wish for a fate worse than death for "king" \louis.

\(relaxed)
Not because of what he has done, but for what he is and what he represents to
the royalists.
\stop

\startcondorcet
No.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startcondorcet[continued]
No; no; no, no, no.
\stop

\stage Pause. The \patrons begin to whisper.

\stage \condorcet begins to pant.

\startcondorcet[continued]
Ah. I see. I think I see. Wait...

\(resolute)
No. It is not necessary that we kill king \louis.

Humans shape their tools which in turn shape themselves, so we know that the
tools we shape for our collaboration are also tools that shape our behavior.

\(beat)
Meaning that by selecting the correct tools, we can select the correct
behaviors.

Therefore, once a republic is formed, people will begin to have faith in the
institutions, not the people who operate them.

\(beat)
But we, uh... we must be... well... No! THEREFORE!

\(stands proudly)
Since we can reason from the principle of universal empathy that those who
operate these institutions can do so according to the same interpretation of
the institution's function, and since this interpretation is written through
elected representatives...

\(nods)
We can conclude... that the power of the public reason is the sole instrument
of the public welfare if... and only if... there exists a \underbar{proper}
institution for public instruction!
\stop

\stage \sophie gasps.

\startsophie
Yes! I think I understand! You mean that because we can reason about our
emotions... and...

\(nods)
And since these emotions are based on our relationships with others... we know
that this reason can not only be used to teach ourselves, but also to teach our
children?
\stop

\stage \condorcet gasps!

\startcondorcet
YES! That's correct!
\stop

\startsophie
The science of the mind!
\stop

\startcondorcet
The science of humanity!
\stop

\stage \brissot contemplates, then relaxes.

\startbrissot
Ah-h, I see-e-e. Alright, yes. I'm impressed, \condorcet.

\(beat)
I concede: if executions can be decided by an institution, then this power
can be used for political advantage through collusion - and that cannot be
tolerated.
\stop

\stage \sophie gasps. \condorcet is stunned!

\startbrissot[continued]
\(to \paine)
See? The man has a way of keeping my head on straight!
\stop

\stage \condorcet seems to be in a stupor.

\startpaine
But none of this answered the original question.
\stop

\startbrissot
Huh? How so?
\stop

\startpaine
I admit that I was wrong about having \louis exiled immediately.

So, considering the circumstances, I think the best thing to do with your king
right now is to address the public and call for the formation of a new
republic - to hell with being arrested.
