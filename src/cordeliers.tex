\open The Convent of the Cordeliers. A crowd of \sansculottes are stirring in
anticipation.

\stage Enter \marat and \danton.

\stage The \sansculottes are riotous.

The friend of the people!

\stage \marat stands on a makeshift podium.

\startmarat
WE HAVE BEEN BETRAYED!
\stop

\stage The \sansculottes enter a frenzy!

\startmarat[continued]
The cowards at the assembly have just decided to offer the king and his whore
amnesty for their attempt to wage a war against the revolution!

Led by his Austrian spy, \louis[formal] - this man who has made himself a
bastard - wants nothing less than to lead a foreign army into Paris so that
they may rule over twenty-five million corpses!

And our corrupt deputies at the National Assembly have just forgave them!

They wipe their asses with the rights of man!

\(beat)
By September, we shall see France hand over the power of the army to this man
who would trample upon the innocent, the poor, the starving - out of their
disgust for men who demand NOTHING BUT THEIR DIGNITY!

They would steal the bread from your stomachs out of spite!

\(beat)
This day last year, five hundred heads would have sufficed; today, fifty
thousand are necessary!

And if we don't act, by the end of the year, France shall need FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND HEADS!

Paris would be flooded with blood and not be any freer for it!
\stop

\stage \danton's bellowing laugh of disbelief can hardly be heard over the
commotion.

\startsansculottes
TO THE ASSEMBLY! WE START TODAY!
\stop

\startdanton
CITIZENS! CITIZENS!
\stop

\stage The \sansculottes simmer down.

\startsansculotte[number=2]
Quiet! \danton speaks!
\stop

\startdanton
Let's not lose our own heads before we begin taking theirs!

\(bellowing laugh)
\marat's feverish spirit speaks to all our hearts, but we must act with the
same care as with all our labors!

Think of our women! We would frighten them to return coated in the blood of
reckless abandon.

Instead, we must save our barbarity for the sheets, but only after we impress
them with our civility!

\(beat)
I happen to know that all of Paris feels much the same way we do about the
king's treachery.

We still yet have hope for our patriotism to shine in the public fervor.

I say we write a petition to overturn this vote in the name of the people!
\stop

\stage The \sansculottes applaud.

\startdanton[continued]
We will take to the Champ-de-Mars, to the altar of the Fatherland; the petition
will be signed by all who now hate their king as much as he hates us!

\(beat)
Failing that, then we'll start shaving the bastards!
\stop

\stage \danton laughs. The \sansculottes cheer.
