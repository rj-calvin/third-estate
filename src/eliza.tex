\scene

\open Winter, 1822. The residence of \vernet[madame].

\stage A knock at the door.

\stage Enter \vernet to answer.

\startvernet
What in the lord's name makes my company worth the visit in such cold?

Who are you, dear?
\stop

\stage Enter \eliza.

\starteliza
Pardon me, madame. Am I correct in assuming this to be the \vernet residence~-
are you the widow of the estate?
\stop

\startvernet
Did my question bounce off your ears? Who are you, darling?
\stop

\starteliza
I suppose that's a yes. And - yes, excuse my imposture.

I have been told that you once knew my father.

That you had provided him shelter here in the year, uh, seventeen ninety-three?

My name is \eliza[full].
\stop

\stage \vernet is suddenly swept by emotion! She embraces \eliza~- who doesn't
know how to react.

\startvernet
OH, MY SWEET BABY CHILD!

\beat

My lord! MY LORD! Please, remove your coat! Come in!

Allow me to fetch us coffee.
\stop

\starteliza
Oh, no thank you. I have noticed that coffee gives me troubled sleep.
\stop

\startvernet
Troubled sleep is often what I'm looking for, darling.
\stop

\stage \vernet wags her hips at \eliza. \vernet chuckles as she whisks herself
away.

\stage Pause. Silence.

\stage \eliza carefully studies the room~- as if searching for a ghost.

\stage Enter \vernet with two cups of coffee.

\startvernet
Dearest! You must tell me how your mother is doing! Is she well?
\stop

\stage \eliza snaps to attention: "no."

\starteliza
Actually, my mother is what brings me here. She... well, she had passed away
this last September.
\stop

\stage \vernet is stunned.

\starteliza
Before she had passed, she had told me that some of my father's writings had
been kept with you, and~- well, I suppose that she wished for me to continue
her work in ensuring their publication.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startvernet
Your mother never told you about your father?
\stop

\starteliza
Hm? No, she most certainly has. She would talk about his philosophy all the
time.

\beat{chuckles}

I would often overhear her talking to him like he's her imaginary friend.

When I asked about it, she told me that he helps her organize her thoughts.
\stop

\startvernet
She only spoke of his philosophy?
\stop

\starteliza
Yes. About his beliefs of liberty and equality, the virtues of~--
\stop

\startvernet
-- NONESENSE! Darling, have you not learned of his fate?
\stop

\starteliza
Well, of course I know about the revolution! I know of his participation! I
know he succumbed to the guillotine like the rest of the Girondins at the hands
of villainous men.
\stop

\startvernet
Oh, child. Oh, oh, my sweet child. This is unacceptable. This {\emph must} be
remedied!
\stop

\startsplit

\starteliza
I don't --?
\stop

\split

\startvernet
-- FEAR NOT! For I, darling, am now an angel of fate!
\stop

\stopsplit

\stage \eliza stands, uncomfortable.

\starteliza
My apologies, madame. But I am mostly interested in the documents.
\stop

\stage \vernet is stunned!

\starteliza
Are you alright? Did I offend you? Do you not have them?
\stop

\startvernet
You strike me as someone as stubborn as your father.
\stop

\starteliza
Is that a kind of tactic to entice me to learn more from you?
\stop

\stage Pause. \vernet smiles.

\startvernet
Yes, and no, dear! I do have the letters.

\beat

However, I pray that you are in no rush to enter back out into this biting
weather.

Allow me to indulge you this tale as compensation for a room to stay and a meal
in the morning.
\stop

\starteliza
That. Yes, that sounds excellent.
\stop

\stage \vernet gives \eliza a hug~- again, she fails to respond.

\startvernet
My apologies for having raised my voice, dear.

Even if I am an angel of fate and destiny.
\stop

\starteliza
I suppose I've grown used to loud passions.
\stop

\startvernet
Now. Allow me to fetch those letters.
\stop

\stage Exit \vernet~- taking her coffee with her.

\stage \eliza sits back down and eyes her coffee.

\stage Pause. \eliza makes her decision and partakes.

\stage Enter \vernet~- carrying a trunk with both hands while balancing her
coffee on top.

\stage \vernet sets down the trunk.

\starteliza
He wrote a trunk's worth of dialogue under your care?
\stop

\startvernet
No, dear. This box is where I keep all my letters.
\stop

\stage \eliza opens the trunk.

\starteliza
Oh...
\stop

\stage \vernet smirks.

\starteliza
This is going to be a migraine to sort.
\stop

\stage \eliza gets comfortable and begins. \vernet then joins her.

\stage Pause while the two establish their workflow.

\startvernet
Might I ask. Why choose such terrible weather to pursue this in?
\stop

\starteliza
There are fewer arrests during bad weather. It makes walking the streets safer
for me.
\stop

\startvernet
So you really are as stubborn as your father.
\stop

\starteliza
\beat{chuckles}

Was that what you meant?
\stop

\startvernet
We French clearly cannot handle politics.
\stop

\starteliza
All our faults are rooted in a failure of education.
\stop

\startvernet
Oh, I'm sure that's true, honey.

But dear, I have seen France go from a monarchy, to a constitutional monarchy,
to a republic, followed by another republic, then an empire, then a monarchy,
then back to an empire, until now another monarchy.

\beat

Our hearts simply burn with far too much fire.
\stop

\starteliza
That's not true: humans shape their tools~--
\stop

\startsplit

\startvernet
\beat{in a shrill voice}

-- which in turn shape themselves!
\stop

\split

\starteliza
-- which in turn shape themselves.
\stop

\stopsplit

\stage \eliza is bewildered.

\starteliza
What was that voice?
\stop

\stage \vernet laughs.

\startvernet
That is how your father sounded, dear!

\beat{imitating \condorcet}

"Truth has prevailed! Humanity is saved!"
\stop

\stage \eliza stops sorting.

\starteliza
That couldn't possibly be how he sounded, you jest.
\stop

\startvernet
I'm sorry, dear, but I am afraid it's true!
\stop

\stage \eliza concentrates for a moment.

\stage \eliza resumes sorting.
