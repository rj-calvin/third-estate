\scene

\open \eliza's bedroom. \sophie is standing silent and still over a cradle.

\stage Enter \condorcet.

\startcondorcet
\sophie. I-I --
\stop

\startsophie
-- I know.
\stop

\startcondorcet
I didn't think --
\stop

\startsophie
-- I understand.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startsophie[continued]
Why is it that I feel as if putting \eliza to bed has become a betrayal of my
principles?

\(beat)
Yesterday, this would be a moment for love and intimacy, but now...
\stop

\startcondorcet
But now you think of your trouble with \charlotte?
\stop

\startsophie
But why must that be so? What has changed from yesterday?

My feelings about \charlotte have nothing to do with my relationship with
\eliza, yet now one has contaminated the other.
\stop

\startcondorcet
That's not true.
\stop

\startsophie
But I feel it as so, and I must feel it for a reason.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Hm, that's true.
\stop

\stage Enter \voltaire.

\startvoltaire
She is in pain. Suffering in silence within her philosophy.
\stop

\stage Enter \leibniz.

\startleibniz
We can help her by examining the causes!
\stop

\startvoltaire
Causes can only go as far as our awareness of them.

Right now, we must observe her.

We must ask: where do feelings such as this come from?

From what manner of experiences?

And under what circumstances?
\stop

\startleibniz
I see, but this would be merely speculation.
\stop

\startvoltaire
I disagree. This is an act of translation.

\sophie communicates to us with the history of our friendship.

And it is our duty to her that we decode her message.
\stop

\startleibniz
But how can you be so sure that the message is the correct one?
\stop

\startvoltaire
I can't ever be sure, but that isn't what is necessary.
\stop

\startleibniz
Care to demonstrate?
\stop

\startvoltaire
Sure.

\(beat)
You picture a young woman who is up late at night, hiding from her privileged
catholic family.

She has found a retreat within the attic to read some seditious literature that
had been forbidden by her father.

We assume she must have procured it by some maniacal scheme of hers.

\(beat)
And such a treasure it was that this literature happened to be my own!

What reward for her cunning it was to be here, lit by candlelight, cramped into
a corner of the attic, stifling her giggles in conspiracy!

% She must have gotten to the part where Candide ...

\(beat)
But alas, she laughs a little too loudly and destiny would have it that her
elder sister would discover her treachery.

The sisters enter a heated exchange, culminating in one stealing my story from
the other and burning it with the lit candle.

The sister then tosses the burning book into the yard through the attic window,
catching a nearby tree on fire.

\(beat)
Aghast, the sisters both rush into the yard to put out the flames.

To no avail, the two whip the flames with blankets - both terrified of the
heat, and their impending judgement.

Thus it was when the patriarch emerged from the house, that one sister rushes
to denounce the other -

accusing her of reading Voltaire and having become an atheist - oh, such a
cruel betrayal!

The patriarch, without reason and without appeal, delivers his punishment,

then retreats back into the house with his daughter, leaving the young woman
alone with the burning tree.

\(beat)
NO! She thinks! FUCK Voltaire!

We DO live in the best of all possible worlds!

And it is imperative that everyone be made to understand this!

\(beat)
She then breaks down into inconsolable tears.

The kind of which define the axioms - the structure - of the psyche.

And thus, so it was, there lit by the burning tree, where she vowed never to
cry again.
\stop

\direction \thestranger whispers to \condorcet.

\startcondorcet
\(to \sophie)
I don't understand why \charlotte refuses to learn.

\(beat)
Wait, no... that's not quite it...

\(beat)
Why she refuses to be taught by you.
\stop

\stage \sophie struggles to maintain her composure.

\startcondorcet[continued]
I - uh, I just don't yet understand. It doesn't seem to make any sense.

I'm sorry.
\stop

\stage \sophie hugs \condorcet and breathes.
