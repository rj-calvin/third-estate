\scene

\open \eliza's bedroom. \sophie is standing silent and still over a cradle.

\stage Enter \condorcet.

\startcondorcet
\sophie. I-I --
\stop

\startsophie
-- I know.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Seeing \brissot worked up like that... I was --
\stop

\startsophie
-- I understand.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startsophie[continued]
Why is it that I feel as if putting \eliza to bed has become a betrayal of my
principles?

\(beat)
Yesterday, this would be a moment for love and intimacy, but now...
\stop

\startcondorcet
But now you think of your differences with \charlotte?
\stop

\startsophie
But why must that be so? What has changed from yesterday?

My feelings about \charlotte have nothing to do with my relationship with
\eliza, yet now one has contaminated the other.
\stop

\startcondorcet
That's not true.
\stop

\startsophie
But I feel it as so, and I must feel it for a reason.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Hm, that's true.
\stop

\stage Enter \voltaire.

\startvoltaire
She is grieving. Her philosophizing is an attempt to take control of her pain.
\stop

\stage Enter \leibniz.

\startleibniz
We can help her by examining the causes!
\stop

\startvoltaire
That will help her philosophy, but not her pain.
\stop

\startcondorcet
If you feel this way for a reason, then we should consider the causes.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startsophie
Why does she refuse to understand? Why does she insist that I'm merely
stubborn?
\stop

\startcondorcet
She hasn't yet learned that she has the capacity to rely on her own reason.

People must be taught that they themselves are intelligent.

Only then can anyone truly experience liberty.
\stop

\startsophie
I have tried to teach her, but she refuses to learn. She will insist that
reasoning is something only for men.

If I persist, she goes as far as to accuse me of attacking her character!
\stop

\startcondorcet
Oh, no...
\stop

\startsophie
How can one teach someone who does not wish to learn?
\stop

\startleibniz
Doubtful that this is the case. Learning is a necessary consequence of our
ability to interpret our senses.
\stop

\startcondorcet
She seemed to have enjoyed my discussion earlier.

Particularly the story I had told.

She asked a good question and had correctly identified the lesson of the story.

\(beat)
Perhaps you give her too little credit?
\stop

\startsophie
Or perhaps it's because you aren't a woman.
\stop

\startcondorcet
My observation is that it isn't too late for her to learn.

She just needs to be in an environment where she feels like such an endeavor is
encouraged.

One where she feels comfortable.
\stop

\startsophie
But... but...
\stop

\startvoltaire
But what makes it so different when it is her own sister who is teaching?
\stop

\stage \condorcet comforts \sophie.

\startcondorcet
I don't know why it must be so different for you.
\stop

\stage \sophie visibly struggles to maintain her composure.

\startcondorcet[continued]
But I can make a difference now.

I'll do everything I can to make sure education becomes free for everyone.

Including women like your sister and, of course, like our dear little woman,
\eliza.
\stop

\stage \sophie takes a deep breath.
