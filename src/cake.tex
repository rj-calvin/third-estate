\startcomponent cake

\scene

\open Fall 1791. The H\^otel des Monnaies salon. \sophie, \paine, \charlotte,
and \cabanis are waiting on \condorcet. \sophie is carrying an infant. A small
cake has been prepared.

\startcharlotte
So, it's true? \condorcet really does talk to himself?
\stop

\startsophie
Every night I overhear him.
\stop

\stage \paine laughs.

\startcharlotte
What does he say?
\stop

\startsophie
It's not something I could share, really...

I shouldn't.

\(beat)
Anyhow, it's usually difficult to make any sense of it worth telling. He speaks
like he still has an imaginary friend, so you only ever hear half of the
conversation.
\stop

\startcabanis
Why do you think he does it?
\stop

\startsophie
I suspect that it's because he lacks a father figure.
\stop

\stage \charlotte shakes her head solemnly.

\startpaine
Well. That's not exactly true.
\stop

\startcharlotte
No, no, monsieur. \condorcet's father died when he was only an infant.
\stop

\startpaine
Pardon me, but that's not what I meant.
\stop

\startsophie
Oh?
\stop

\startpaine
As I've gotten to know him these last few months, it's pretty clear that he has
	{\emph some} form of father figure.
\stop

\startsophie
Oh. Yes. You're right. That's a good point.
\stop

\startcabanis
What's this?
\stop

\startpaine
It's pretty clear he thinks of \voltaire as his father.
\stop

\startsophie
I wouldn't put it that way... but... you do have a point.
\stop

\startpaine
How so?
\stop

\stage \sophie puzzles for a moment.

\startsophie
Ah! I've mistaken what distinguishes a form from a figure!

\(beat)
My original theory was that the impact of not having a father around while he
was a child changed how he behaves today.

But it's true that we can't rule out the impact other mentors can have and
shouldn't be quick to judge how these mentors compare to an authentic father.
\stop

\stage \paine puzzles on this.

\startpaine
I think that sounds about right. As far as we know, he might just find talking
to himself useful.
\stop

\startcharlotte
I think it's adorable.
\stop

\stage \sophie laughs.
