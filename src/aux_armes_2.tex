\stage \condorcet is startled. \sophie giggles.

\startcondorcet
Huh, what's this about?
\stop

\startbrissot
We were only discussing how rude it is for philosophers to ignore their
company.
\stop

\stage \sophie punches \brissot in the arm. \brissot laughs.

\startpaine
He is certainly braver than I am in ignoring conversations that bore him.

\(chuckles)
I should do it more often.
\stop

\startsophie
Monsieur \paine has suggested that we pursue the publication of a new journal
on the subject of republicanism.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Ah! What a beautiful idea!
\stop

\startbrissot
I still insist that the climate is not yet right for such a bold display.
\stop

\startcondorcet
The timing is perfect! The king has shattered the public fealty; why wouldn't
we pursue this opportunity?
\stop

\startbrissot
I'm not saying you shouldn't, I'm saying that it would be wise to proceed
cautiously.

\(beat)
The royalists, while undoubtedly a minority, are nonetheless loud, crude,
vicious, and worst of all - stupid.

They know they are weak and they feel themselves backed into a corner.

My guess is that they are waiting for someone to speak up on the republic so
they can make an example of them.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Ha! If it's bullies that have you afraid, I shall tell you that I am no
stranger.

As a boy, my mother forbade me from wearing my breeches until I had reached the
age of nine.

I assure you that the cruelty of child-like minds are not a burden to me.
\stop

\stage \paine and \brissot stifle their laughter. \sophie punches each in the
arm.

\startbrissot
Even so. While they are certainly no better than children, they are well
practiced in the art of baseless insults.

\(beat)
Nonetheless, I am not against the idea of a new journal - in fact, I believe I
could even applaud it - but I'm afraid I can't afford to be seen as an
accomplice.
\stop

\startpaine
You know what has me afraid? I'm afraid you're toying with us.

What are these covert plans I sense you have?
\stop

\startcondorcet
Plans? Are you withholding your agenda again?
\stop

\startbrissot
In due time, gentlemen. In due time.
\stop

\startcondorcet
You lack considerable faith in your allies.
\stop

\startpaine
He must suspect us of being politicians.
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
I would never!
