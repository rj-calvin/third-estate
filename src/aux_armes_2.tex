\scene

\stage \condorcet is startled. \sophie giggles.

\startcondorcet
Huh, what's this about?
\stop

\startbrissot
We were only discussing how rude it is for philosophers to ignore their
company.
\stop

\stage \sophie punches \brissot in the arm. \brissot laughs.

\startpaine
He is certainly braver than I am in ignoring conversations that bore him.

\(chuckles)
I should do it more often.
\stop

\startsophie
Monsieur \paine has suggested that we pursue the publication of a new journal
on the subject of republicanism.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Ah! What a beautiful idea!
\stop

\startbrissot
I still insist that the climate is not yet right for such a bold display.
\stop

\startcondorcet
The timing is perfect - the king has shattered his own crown! Why wouldn't we
pursue this opportunity?
\stop

\startbrissot
I'm not against the idea itself, but what I'm suggesting is that it would be
best to wait until after the coming legislative elections.

The alliance of Barnave and Lafeyette is already certain to maintain the
monarchy, meaning you'd be putting your campaign at risk for no strategic
benefit.
\stop

\startsophie
Risk? What kind of risk?
\stop

\startbrissot
The royalists. While they're undoubtedly a minority, they're nonetheless loud,
crude, vicious, and worst of all - shameless.

They know their position is weak and they feel themselves backed into a corner.

My guess is that they're waiting for someone to speak up on the republic so
they can make an example of them in their broadsheets.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Ha! If it's bullies that have you afraid, I shall tell you that I am no
stranger.

As a boy, my mother forbade me from wearing my breeches until I had reached the
age of nine.

I assure you that the cruelty of child-like minds are not a burden to me.
\stop

\stage \paine and \brissot stifle their laughter. \sophie punches each in the
arm.

\startbrissot
Children or no, they are well practiced in the art of baseless insults.

\(beat)
And again, I am not against the idea of a new journal - in fact, I believe I
could even applaud it - but I'm afraid I can't afford to be seen as an
accomplice.
\stop

\startpaine
You know what has me afraid? I'm afraid you've been toying with us.
\stop

\startbrissot
Oh?
\stop

\startpaine
I have the sense that you're planning something that you've yet to reveal.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Plans? Are you withholding your agenda again?
\stop

\startbrissot
In due time, gentlemen. In due time.
\stop

\startcondorcet
You lack considerable faith in your allies.
\stop

\startpaine
He must suspect us of being politicians.
\stop

\stage \brissot laughs.

\startbrissot
I would never!
\stop

\stage \paine laughs.

\startsophie
\brissot.
\stop

\startbrissot
Hm? Yes, Madame?
\stop

\startsophie
In your little speech earlier, you spoke as if you had that rehearsed.
\stop

\startbrissot
I'm a talented improvisationalist. I speak from the heart.
\stop

\startsophie
Yet, that's what has me confused. Your speech would have fallen flat had it not
been for the drunkard playing along.

How did you know he would provide you your punchline?
\stop

\stage \brissot is impressed.

\startbrissot
You're insinuating I wouldn't take a gamble like that on a whim.

Alright, such a sharp eye deserves the respect of honesty.

\(beat)
Truth is, I had paid the man prior to our arrival.
\stop

\startcondorcet
What? You paid him? Why go through such an effort for a simple laugh?
\stop

\startpaine
Gossip.
\stop

\startbrissot
An astute learner. He may become a proper Frenchman yet.
\stop

\startcondorcet
Gossip?
\stop

\startsophie
What kind of gossip?
\stop

\stage \brissot clears his throat, then stands on his chair. The
\crowd[patrons] turn to look at him.

\startbrissot
TO ARMS! TO ARMS!
\stop

\startcrowd[cue={Patrons}]
TO ARMS! TO ARMS!
\stop

\stage The \crowd[patrons] laugh.

\startbrissot
All the world's a stage, my friends.
\stop

\instruction An infant begins to cry from the other room.
