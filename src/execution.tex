\startvoltaire
Traveling across northern France, a man beset by the weight of his words, the
weight of his errors, and the weight of his uncertainty watches eastward
through the window of his carriage into the pitch of night.

His wife sits beside him as she pleads with a young man he has never met.

She speaks to him of her fear of the public: the violence that she has seen,
the hatred she has heard, and insists to the young man how she only wishes for
the safety of her children.

But then, something stops her. Choked up by a memory of a time long ago.

\(beat)
In a small, broken voice she recalls her hamlet back in Versailles - the
quaint, rustic little retreat where she would escape the banal politicking of
the palace.

Despite most of the hamlet's beauty being handled by caretakers - she notes
that there was one particular cottage, the smallest of the lot, that was hers
and hers alone.

\(beat)
She remembers a particular morning when she was tending the garden outside this
cottage, that she had looked up to see, across the pond, the first glimpse of
sunrise.

Her voice paints the scene with bright, na\"ive, sentimental colors, delivered
with a sincerity that is not lost on the enchanted young man.

\(beat)
Meanwhile, the beset man hides his tears as he stares out into the void beyond
his window, furrowing his beset brow as he searches the darkness - desperate to
reclaim something that has been lost.

\(beat)
"Tomorrow," he thinks... "tomorrow, I shall watch the sunrise."
