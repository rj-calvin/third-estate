\scene

\open Outside the \jacobin club.

\stage Enter \condorcet and \brissot.

\startbrissot
WOO-O-O! What a rush!

God, I love the sound of applause!

\beat

I think I really won over some people's prejudices there, did you hear how they
applauded me at the end there - with the bit about the progress of
enlightenment?
\stop

\startcondorcet
Well... of course I did, \brissot. But --
\stop

\startbrissot
-- Though, can you believe the audacity of \robespierre?

How can any man be so nakedly villainous and not feel even the slightest hint
of shame?
\stop

\startcondorcet
Tho(ugh) - well, actually, I wanted to --
\stop

\startbrissot
-- "The enemies are amongst yourselves!" What nonsense!

And then he dares to accuse me of having some --
\stop

\startcondorcet
-- "A nation must have war to consolidate it!?"

\brissot! How could you say such a thing!?
\stop

\startbrissot
Huh?
\stop

\startcondorcet
You say you want enlightenment, yet - yet, yet you call~--?
\stop

\startbrissot
What? You actually {\emph agreed} with him? How could you possibly~--?
\stop

\startcondorcet
-- What? NO! I have {\emph always} insisted with you that war is obsolete in
any enlightened society!

\beat

I have ALWAYS insisted~--!
\stop

\startbrissot
-- Woah! Woah! My friend! Have I... \condorcet, I had no idea that I would hurt
you like this.
\stop

\stage \condorcet has been swiftly disarmed.

\startbrissot
But, \condorcet, I'm my own man.

I don't see how your position should necessarily affect my own.
\stop

\startcondorcet
But it's a matter of reason! It's a matter~--
\stop

\startbrissot
-- \condorcet. It's a matter of {\emph debate}. Have you forgotten why it is
we're here?

Is your mind still at your desk at home?

\beat

Now, it's true that the thought of having offended you weighs heavy on my
heart, but it is also not fair for you to yell at me like a mad sheep just
because I fail to share your perspective on every matter.
\stop

\startcondorcet
But - but...
\stop

\startbrissot
Calm yourself. Recall what you've said to me when politics had gotten the
better of me in the past.
\stop

\stage \condorcet takes a breath.

\startcondorcet
We are all born with the ability to receive sensations; to perceive them and to
distinguish them.
\stop

\startbrissot
To remember, recognize --
\stop

\startsplit

\startbrissot
-- and combine them.
\stop

\split

\startcondorcet
-- and combine them.
\stop

\stopsplit

\startcondorcet
To compare their combinations; identify what is common and what is not.

To represent their discoveries with signs and symbols.
\stop

\startbrissot
\beat{chuckles}

And at last, they have linked their knowledge to the eternal chain of human
destiny!
\stop

\startcondorcet
One step forward to a destination infinitely far away!
\stop

\startbrissot
-- Wait! There's a crowd coming!
\stop

\direction The \sansculottes are heard from a distance.

\startcondorcet
Oh, dear, I think it would be best if we~--
\stop

\startmarat[offstage]
-- If the \jacobins reject our petition, we shall have nine hundred heads
tonight! SO HELP ME GOD!
\stop

\startsansculottes[offstage]
Death to intriguers! Death to schemers!
\stop

\startmarat[offstage]
DEATH TO THE CABAL!
\stop

\stage Enter \danton, carrying a few documents.

\startdanton
{\WORDS\brissot}! Good to see you this evening, mister patriot!
\stop

\stage \danton gives \brissot a hardy handshake.

\startbrissot
\danton, what brings you and the, uh...

\beat{looks over \danton's shoulder}

... the other Cordeliers to the \jacobin?
\stop

\startdanton
To start an insurrection, of course!
\stop

\startbrissot
So, uh, so soon? The elections to the Legislative Assembly aren't for another
few months.
\stop

\stage \danton gives a bellowing laugh. \brissot feigns joining him.

\startdanton
I'm just fucking with you, brother! I'll tell you all about it inside, heh?
\stop

\startcondorcet
I'm actually a bit fatigued... I think~--
\stop

\startdanton
-- Ah! And how's the philosopher doing?
\stop

\startcondorcet
Oh, I have been excellent, t-thank you.
\stop

\startdanton
Glad to hear it! Not letting all the thinking keep you from satisfying that
adorable wife of yours, is it?
\stop

\startcondorcet
Oh.
\stop

\startbrissot
\danton! I think the club is ready to exit recess.
\stop

\startmarat[offstage]
NEW SANITATION METHODS WILL BE NEEDED WHEN OUR STREETS RUN WITH BLOOD!
\stop

\startdanton
They must have heard the herald of Poseidon.
\stop

\stage Exit \danton and \brissot.

\direction The singing of La Prise de la Bastille begins.

\stage Exit \condorcet.
