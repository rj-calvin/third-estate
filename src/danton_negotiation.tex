\scene

\open Summer 1792. Home office of \danton.

\stage Enter \robespierre.

\startdanton
Ah! There's the haunt of Paris!
\stop

\startrobespierre
Good evening, \danton.
\stop

\stage \robespierre takes a seat as \danton pours him a drink. \robespierre
never touches the glass.

\startdanton
So. What's the rush to get a meeting with me?
\stop

\startrobespierre
I wished to discuss with (you) --
\stop

\startdanton
-- You're lucky, by the way.

\(beat)
If my buddy Camille didn't insist that, deep down, you were truly a cuddly
little kitten, I would not have made the time for this meeting.
\stop

\startrobespierre
Camille is a childhood friend of (mine) --
\stop

\startdanton
-- You know.

\(deep breath)
This war, brother; this war. Three months in and the enemy rampages through our
borders. Burning our grain - raping our women... Fucking. Disaster.
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startdanton
You know what I think? I think \louis is up to something. He must be~--
\stop

\startrobespierre
-- I agree. It's obvious that \louis would wish to sabotage the war to advance
his schemes.

Allowing the enemy to march into Paris to take our heads allows him to restore
the monarchy.
\stop

\startdanton
This shit's bad, brother. I admit, you were damn right about the whole thing
all along.
\stop

\startrobespierre
True. However, I believe that it is a mistake to assume that it is \louis who
we must fear.

I believe France's true enemies are the fools at the assembly who clumsily
threw us into this atrocious war.
\stop

\stage \danton laughs.

\startdanton
You mean \brissot? Aw! Not mister patriot!
\stop

\stage \danton chuckles.

\stage \robespierre stands to pace the office.

\startrobespierre
I believe that \brissot has invented a new form of evil that history has failed
to prepare us for.

This charlatan wears the mask of patriotism to subvert the revolution from
within.

He leads the people to believe in a false reality that does nothing but support
his ego and his treachery.

And indeed, he does this despite knowing the costs~- knowing that the price of
his ego is the very lives of French citizens!

He has made a {\emph mockery} of the revolution!
\stop

\startdanton
Listen. I have no interest in your personal feud with mister patriot.
\stop

\startrobespierre
Personal? I assure you that I have no ambitions for personal satisfaction.

I consider it my duty to the people that this evil be destroyed before it
further plunges the revolution into darkness.
\stop

\startdanton
Your duty... to the people...
\stop

\stage \robespierre sneers.

\startrobespierre
It is my duty because I am the only one who sees this danger!

\(deep breath)
You see... \danton...

I have come to you today because I fear that you too have been led astray by
his chicanery.
\stop

\startdanton
\(squares up)
Oh, is that so?
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startrobespierre
I understand you have gained considerable influence over the National Guard.

Yet, from what I see, they nonetheless remain idle.
\stop

\startdanton
Idle? Fuck off! If you haven't noticed, France is defending itself from siege.

As we speak, the Guard is fortifying the borders of Paris.
\stop

\startrobespierre
Meanwhile, this force could instead be used for the offensive.
\stop

\startdanton
I have no intention of marching to Verdun and leaving our city defenseless.
\stop

\startrobespierre
You fail to understand my meaning. Consider instead the enemy already present
in Paris.
\stop

\startdanton
No. I will not send the Guard to slaughter the assembly just because you asked
me nicely.
\stop

\startrobespierre
You continue to misunderstand. I am asking why you have not sent your soldiers
to the Tuileries itself.
\stop

\startdanton
Ah... An insurrection? Well...

\(deep breath)
I don't see the need for it.

The conservatives at the assembly fled Paris when the riots began.

It's only \brissot and his pals left making decisions.

So, as far as I can tell, that matter will sort itself out any day now.
\stop

\startrobespierre
You --
\stop

\startdanton
-- Shut up. I get your damn meaning. Call me skeptical of this whole thing you
have with \brissot.

You talk a big talk about the man, but I have yet to see you provide any
evidence that the man is anything but a genuine patriot.
\stop

\startrobespierre
Evidence?
\stop

\startdanton
Yeah. Proof.
\stop

\stage \robespierre hesitates~- he underestimated \danton.

\startrobespierre
A reasonable request.

\(beat)
Regrettably, I have none to offer.
\stop

\stage \danton is prepared to show him the door.

\startrobespierre
However. Might I offer an alternative?
\stop

\startdanton
A what?
\stop

\startrobespierre
In the place of evidence, I shall offer you a prediction.

\(beat)
Should my prediction come to pass, then you will find in it the evidence that
you seek.

Should my prediction fail, the only cost to you will have been the time you
have already given me.
\stop

\startdanton
What's the prediction?
\stop

\startrobespierre
Do we have an arrangement?
\stop

\startdanton
What's the prediction?
\stop

\stage Pause.

\startrobespierre
I predict that when the time comes for the assembly to act, \brissot will fail
to depose the king.

Instead, I predict that the assembly will choose to merely {\emph suspend} the
king.
\stop

\stage \danton laughs.

\startdanton
Bullshit! No way he does that, it would be suicide!
\stop

\startrobespierre
Or, he hesitates to destroy the very throne that he wishes for himself.
\stop

\stage \danton scoffs.

\startrobespierre
Would such an outcome serve as sufficient evidence?
\stop

\startdanton
Damn right it would! I'm telling you: no man in their right mind would suspend
the king.

That's the exact same slap on the wrist that the royalists gave him for trying
to flee to fucking Austria!
\stop

\startrobespierre
Then we have an arrangement.
\stop

\startdanton
Yeah. I suppose we do.
\stop

\stage The two shake hands.

\stage Exit \robespierre.

\stage \danton has a lot to contemplate. He takes the untouched drink and paces
the office.

\startdanton
Camille, my boy, that friend of yours is not a cuddly kitten.
\stop

\stage \danton downs the drink.
