\scene

\open The Salle du Man\`ege. The \convention[national] has reconvened. A
\representative, by the name of \salles, is positioned at the tribune.

\startsalles
Eighteen hours ago, you have decreed - for the second time - that you are to
give sentence to \louis[xvi].

You have acted as jury in pronouncing his guilt and now you are to act as judge
in pronouncing the sentence.

You have observed that the fate of \louis presented a political question: that
the matter of sentencing was an imperative to the interests of the state.

And that, according to these interests, you do not judge; but decree.

\beat

True. If \louis is to deserve death, and does not suffer it, he will remain a
constant source of discord.

Any assassin henceforth may announce on the scaffold: "Why am I condemned to
this fate? Have I committed a crime worse than the betrayal of my country?"

But should \louis face death, the pretensions of the royalists shall survive
him.

The death of a monarch does not signal the death of a monarchy.

The royalists will survive him through his family, and it is this embarrassing
alternative that manifests the dilemma among the two opposing views of this
assembly.

\beat

The regrets of the past, the evils of the present; a foreign invasion, civil
unrest; and the division of this \convention.

All of these threaten us with the greatest misfortunes.

\beat

Yet, the road forward has already been traced by the factious.

Already, some bold speakers have established the disgusting doctrine of the
inalienable right of every citizen to assassinate \louis.

Already, these factious men have sanctioned the assassination of a thousand
prisoners.

And now... the \convention has inexorably been accused of sharing these maxims.

\beat

Well! What shall we think of these indiscretions? What character do they assume
in my sight?

When representatives continue to invoke the axe of the people against the
\convention itself?

Threatening death to those who fail to deliver death upon \louis?

TRAITORS! What shame!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority applaud and cheer.

\startbarere
Order!
\stop

\startsalles
O, my country!

\beat

I say there is only one method to avoid such great evils.

I say that the \convention, having pronounced the guilt of the regent, should
submit to the people the punishment he ought to suffer.
\stop

\stage \salles dismounts the tribune to great applause from the \leftminority,
and great disdain from the \rightminority.

\startserres
I request the floor, \barere[citizen].
\stop

\stage \barere affirms as --

\startmarat
-- NO! The damned moderates have had their turn!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority viciously protest.

\startleftminority
Murderer! Tyrant!
\stop

\startmarat
HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A TYRANT! WE'LL HAVE YOUR HEADS NEXT!
\stop

\startbarere
Silence! I WILL have you removed from this assembly if you continue these
damnable outbursts.
\stop

\startmarat
SEE!? SEE!? AND YOU CALL ME THE TYRANT!?
\stop

\stage \serres ascends to the tribune.

\startserres
I have no desire to justify the crimes of the accused.

I do not come to raise your compassion for his unhappy situation.

I (have) --
\stop

\startrightminority
-- Royalist!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority look worried. Even \barere gives him a nasty look.

\startserres
I have come to support what I believe to be necessary for the heart of liberty
and safety.

I only ask you: what is the greater danger to the state, the circumstance of
the king's death, or that of his imprisonment?

\beat

I will not insult the French by supposing that the restoration of the King will
eliminate hatred of royalty.

However, I do suppose that his existence, in my opinion, ought to create no
alarm.
\stop

\stage Vicious hatred from the \rightminority.

\startserres
BESIDES! BESIDES!
\stop

\startbarere
ORDER! SILENCE!

\beat

Come on. You all know the same rules apply to everyone.
\stop

\startserres
Besides... you all know that the people of France believe him to have a gentle
heart - that his faults are due to his frailty more-so than his will.

And how he had always been so easily manipulated by that accursed woman who
knew too well how to bend his ear to her schemes.

After all, if \louis is executed, let us not forget his young heir.

And could any of you dare to argue that a child should be punished so severely
for the crimes of their parents?

\beat

I therefore insist that \louis be imprisoned until the conclusion of the war,
and that he be banished upon the arrival of peace.
\stop

\stage Incredible jeers from the \convention as \serres returns to his seat.

\startbuzot
This man is no moderate! He speaks only for himself!
\stop

\startgensonne
\buzot, shut up!
\stop

\startbuzot
But I speak the truth! The decision should be settled by the nation!
\stop

\startmarat
This is clearly biased! Clear favoritism! YOU, SIR, ARE A BIASED WHORESON!
\stop

\stage The \rightminority applaud \marat.

\startmarat
I REQUEST THE FLO-O-OR!
\stop

\startleftminority
NO! Not the dictator! Not him!
\stop

\startbarere
Denied.
\stop

\startmarat
Lock them up! LOCK. THEM. U-U-UP!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority shout at \marat.

\stage The \rightminority look to \robespierre as if they expect something to
happen. He does not move.

\startvergniaud
I request the floor, \barere[citizen]!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority applaud!

\startbarere
\vergniaud, the floor is yours.
\stop

\startrightminority
Death to the moderate!
\stop

\startbarere
Enough!
\stop

\stage \vergniaud[theeagle] ascends to the tribune.

\stage The \rightminority jeer.
