\scene

\open The Salle du Man\`ege. The \convention[national] has reconvened. A
\representative, by the name of \salles, is positioned at the tribune.

\startsalles
Eighteen hours ago, you have acted as jury in pronouncing the guilt of
\louis[xvi].

And now... you are to act as judge in pronouncing the sentence.

You have observed that the fate of \louis presented a political question: that
the matter of sentencing was an imperative to the interests of the state.

And that, according to these interests, you do not judge; but decree.

% But surely, no such decree could prevent any member from giving his opinion on
% the contradiction we are faced with.

\beat

True. If \louis is to deserve death, and does not suffer it, he will remain a
constant source of discord.

Any assassin henceforth may announce on the scaffold: "Why am I condemned to
this fate? Have I committed a crime worse than the betrayal of my country?"

But should \louis face death, the pretensions of the royalists shall survive
him.

The death of a monarch does not signal the death of a monarchy.

The royalists will survive him through his family, and it is this embarrassing
alternative that manifests the dilemma between the two opposing views of this
assembly.

\beat

The regrets of the past, the evils of the present; a foreign invasion, civil
unrest; and the division of this \convention.

All of these threaten us with the greatest misfortunes.

\beat

Yet, the road forward has already been traced by the factious.

Already, some bold speakers have established the disgusting doctrine of the
inalienable right of every citizen to assassinate \louis.

Already, these factious men have sanctioned the assassination of a thousand
prisoners.

And now... the \convention has inexorably been accused of sharing these maxims.

\beat

Well! What shall we think of these indiscretions? What character do they assume
in my sight?

When representatives continue to invoke the axe of the people against the
\convention itself?

Threatening death to those who fail to deliver death upon \louis?

TRAITORS! What shame!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority applaud and cheer.

\startbarere
Order!
\stop

\startsalles
O, my country!

\beat

I say there is only one method to avoid such great evils.

I say that the \convention, having pronounced the guilt of the regent, should
submit to the people the punishment he ought to suffer.
\stop

\stage \salles dismounts the tribune to great applause from the \leftminority,
and great disdain from the \rightminority.

\startserres
I request the floor, \barere[citizen].
\stop

\stage \barere affirms as --

\startmarat
-- NO! The damned moderates have had their turn!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority viciously protest.

\startleftminority
Murderer! Tyrant!
\stop

\startmarat
HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A TYRANT! WE'LL HAVE YOUR HEADS NEXT!
\stop

\startbarere
Silence! I WILL have you removed from this assembly if you continue these
damnable outbursts.
\stop

\startmarat
SEE!? SEE!? AND YOU CALL ME THE TYRANT!?
\stop

\stage \serres ascends to the tribune.

\startserres
I have no desire to justify the crimes of the accused.

I do not come to raise your compassion for his unhappy situation.

I (have) --
\stop

\startrightminority
-- Royalist!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority look worried. Even \barere gives him a nasty look.

\startserres
I have come to support what I believe to be necessary for the heart of liberty
and safety.

I only ask you: what is the greater danger to the state, the circumstance of
the king's death, or that of his imprisonment?

\beat

I will not insult the French by supposing that the restoration of the King will
eliminate hatred of royalty.

However, I do suppose that his existence, in my opinion, ought to create no
alarm.
\stop

\stage Vicious hatred from the \rightminority.

\startserres
BESIDES! BESIDES!
\stop

\startbarere
ORDER! SILENCE!

\beat

Come on. You all know the same rules apply to everyone.
\stop

\startserres
Besides... you all know that the people of France believe him to have a gentle
heart - that his faults are due to his frailty more-so than his will.

And how he had always been so easily manipulated by that accursed woman who
knew too well how to bend his ear to her schemes.

After all, if \louis is executed, let us not forget his young heir.

And could any of you dare to argue that a child should be punished so severely
for the crimes of their parents?

\beat

I therefore insist that \louis be imprisoned until the conclusion of the war,
and that he be banished upon the arrival of peace.
\stop

\stage Incredible jeers from the \convention as \serres returns to his seat.

\startbuzot
This man is no moderate! He speaks only for himself!
\stop

\startgensonne
\buzot, shut up!
\stop

\startbuzot
But I speak the truth! The decision should be settled by the nation!
\stop

\startmarat
This is clearly biased! Clear favoritism! YOU, MONSIEUR, ARE A BIASED WHORESON!
\stop

\stage The \rightminority applaud \marat.

\startmarat
I REQUEST THE FLO-O-OR!
\stop

\startleftminority
NO! Not the dictator! Not him!
\stop

\startbarere
Denied.
\stop

\startmarat
Lock them up! LOCK. THEM. U-U-UP!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority shout at \marat.

\stage The \rightminority look to \robespierre as if they expect something to
happen. He does not move.

\startvergniaud
I request the floor, \barere[citizen]!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority applaud!

\startbarere
\vergniaud, the floor is yours.
\stop

\startrightminority
Death to the moderate!
\stop

\startbarere
Enough!
\stop

\stage \vergniaud[theeagle] ascends to the tribune.

\stage The \rightminority jeer.

\startvergniaud
This discussion of the people... the people... which people, I ask, do I hear
of? The people of France? Or the people of Paris?

The sovereignty of the nation is that of the whole - not merely the largest
metropolis.

And this very same sovereignty, this nation - this {\emph country} - has
unequivocally accepted the constitution as ratified on the day of our
Federation.

Regrettably, this has also ratified the acceptance of a king.

But if! It has been by this sovereign body that a king should be installed, it
must therefore be by this self-same body that a king be removed.

To insist that some Parisian upstarts speak on the behalf of all of France is
an insult to all the principles of public welfare.

\beat

These troubles, these misfortunes that I continue to hear about, have
manifested exclusively within Paris alone.

Ask yourselves, you amongst you who orchestrated the tenth of August, have any
of you even set foot outside of Paris since the beginning of the war?

Have you seen with your own eyes the barbarity you hear incessantly exacerbated
in the journals and broadsheets?

I assure you... beyond the veil of these Parisian borders is a world that is
calm.

A world full of people who wish only for stability and order.

\beat

But is this what I hear being offered by the factious among the \convention?

By the assassins who execute arbitrary laws decided by whims and superstitions?

THE BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTERS WHO CANNIBALISE MY BELOVED COUNTRY?
\stop

\stage The \leftminority cheer in solidarity.

\startvergniaud
You have been told, by ideologues and intriguers, that a public vote will be
the target of inevitable corruption.

Yet, is it not our ambition to install a republican government?

Is it not our intention to replace the monarch with these very same mechanisms
for public choices?

Decriers and hypocrites, AGREE AMONGST YOURSELVES!

\beat

But alas! Your ears have been dinned by the ideology of terror.

You have been manipulated by these decriers - depressed into resorting only to
your most savage instincts so that the ideologues who are embarrassed by their
own ignorance do not need to feel ashamed for having lost all sense of virtue.
\stop

\startsplit

\startbrissot
Here, here!
\stop

\split
\leavevmode

\startgensonne
Here, here!
\stop

\stopsplit

\stage \robespierre sneers - never has a man hated another so deeply.

\startvergniaud
You have heard accusations laid against our country - that our people consist
of an evil within - of a majority composed of schemers, of aristocrats, and
so-called moderates.

But the bold-faced truth is that these accusations are laid against any who are
not sufficiently radical for the tastes of Parisian factions.

The ideology of terror has been weaponized against you - resorting to
radicalization as the only means it has for justifying the HIDEOUSNESS OF
THIS SANGUINE INSANITY!
\stop

\stage The \leftminority cheer.

\startvergniaud
Unhappy Parisians! You who are so worthy of universal liberty, what will become
of you when Paris deprives our city of the sane?

What industry can survive when the industry of slaughter becomes total?

What labours will remain to sustain your families?

Massacres do not grow wheat. They do not distribute grain. They do not bake
bread.

And yet! When the day comes that you must watch your family beg and starve,
what will these perfidious monsters offer you?

These cannibals who dare call themselves your friends?

They will point you to the caverns filled with corpses and exclaim:

"you are oppressed by hunger - dine, then, upon the fruits of my labor!"
\stop

\stage The \convention recoils in horror.

\startvergniaud
Gentlemen, I trust... I trust, that even if my unhappy country should drown in
this ocean of evil, that liberty shall yet buoy itself to the surface.

That liberty shall yet swim.

But fate has not been decided whether we shall succumb to the waters.

Thus, I say, that the fate of our country shall be elected by our country.

I say, that we bring to motion the question: "shall the will of the people be
consulted, and if so, by what means?"
\stop

\stage \vergniaud dismounts the tribune to incredible applause from the
\leftmajority!

\startmarat
ENOUGH OF THIS!
\stop

\stage \marat[thefriend] seizes the tribune.

\stage He squares up to the \convention\ - turning up his chin to the ensuing
shouts and accusations.

\startmarat
I shall not cower to your threats! You accuse me of wishing for a dictatorship?

\beat{spits}

No longer do I say to install a dictatorship!

I have told you this, yet leave it to traitors to deny me my right to change my
mind!
\stop

\startbarere
ORDER! I'll allow it!
\stop

\startmarat
I listen to this violence and vitriol laid against my person, and I have become
convinced that FIFTY YEARS OF ANARCHY AWAIT US!

And after this, you shall see France emerge only through a powerful dictator -
a true patriot and statesman will reveal himself to crush the weakness of greed
and corruption!

Yet what disgusting hate must I continue to suffer in order to win victory over
your failures?

To convince you that such a fate is inevitable should your kind be permitted to
exist?

\beat

But no! I am no longer a believer in a dictatorship! I wish to avoid this!

If only your hate would cease to slow me down!

This party of Girondins are a menace to humanity!
\stop

\startbrissot
You are the party of murderers! What menace is --
\stop

\startmarat
-- SHUT UP! SHUT. UP! HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT ME!

I sat there like a FUCKING ANGEL listening to your precious hero accuse good
patriots of cannibalism!

Oh, but now that poor, foolish \marat is speaking, you get to play the part of
saints? Of warriors for justice and liberty?

Hypocrites and liars - ALL OF YOU!

\beat

Good citizens and patriots, do not listen to these scheming aristocrats and
degenerate moderates!

They are deceivers!

You say that the France beyond Paris is calm? Tranquil? What horseshit! What
ignorance!

They are clearly still in denial that the war they fought so hard to plunge us
into is anything but the swift victory they had promised you!

Wishing in vain to paint a picture of a "polite invasion" of the French
provinces!

\beat{spits}

As if they deliberately wish to erase reality from the blood and ash that coat
Verdun!

To wash clean the wombs of raped women!

To wash away the ugly bits of skull and brain that once belonged to Colonel
Beaurepaire's bastard head!

\beat

Good citizens, loyal patriots, do not listen to their hate. Even their hate is
a lie!

They are nothing but talented actors who believe you too stupid to see through
their false passions!

Think about it!

Only a man of the most sinister and villainous quality could possibly shake
your convictions with a speech THAT HE DIDN'T. EVEN. WRITE. HIMSELF!
\stop

\stage The entire \convention stands in shock!

\startrightminority
FRAUD! FRAUD! {\WORD\vergniaud} IS A FRAUDULENT ORATOR!
\stop

\startcondorcet
WHAT!? NO! REASON IS INDEPENDENT OF THE SPEAKER!
\stop

\startmarat
HA! A CONFESSION! THE MASK OF PATRIOTISM SLIPS!
\stop

\stage A cacophony of insults are laid upon the \leftminority\ - a catastrophic
scandal!

\startmarat
I SAY! I say that no man can be trusted whose words do not come from his heart!

Whose words do not derive from the true passions of their own soul!
\stop

\stage Applause from the \rightmajority!

\startmarat
We must purge France of this disease of moderates! To save France from the
brink of anarchy!

I motion for the formation of a new committee!

A committee formed for the cause of public safety!

A committee comprising only the best and most loyal patriots in the nation!

Such a committee will only need to exist for merely a SINGLE DAY!

A SINGLE DAY I TELL YOU!

And by sunset, ALL of France's problems will be solved at once!
\stop

\stage Outcry from the \leftminority. Applause from the \rightminority.

\startbuzot
{\WORD\marat} IS A DICTATOR!
\stop

\startleftminority
DICTATOR! DICTATOR! DICTATOR!
\stop

\startmarat
THAT'S IT!
\stop

\stage \marat pulls out a pistol! He swings the weapon high above his head -
striking a familiar pose...

\stage The \convention cowers for their lives!

\stage \marat firmly plants the barrel into the side of his head.

\startmarat
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD, IF ONE MORE PERSON CALLS ME A DICTATOR, I WILL BLOW MY
FUCKING BRAINS OUT!
\stop

\stage The \convention erupts in fury!

\startmarat
I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL FUCKING DO IT! YOU'LL ALL WATCH ME DO IT!
\stop

\stage \barere lunges at \marat to wrestle the gun from him.

\stage The \convention immediately enters into total combat. The gun goes off
amidst the calamity!

\stage \robespierre stands and produces a Roman salute.

\stage The violence halts.

\stage \robespierre[theincorruptible] calmly steps down from his seat and
ascends the tribune.

\stage Pause. Silence.

\startrobespierre
Silence? What is this I hear?
\stop

\stage Pause. Silence.
