Suppose we have - oh, I don't know, seven-hundred forty-five representatives
who each rank their preferences for three choices: A, B, and C.

However, unlike before, I have not intention of ascribing any interpretation to
these alternatives - they are totally arbitrary.

Nonetheless, we can assume that any decision function would select choice A if
every participant ranks A highest in their preferences, correct?
\stop

\startleibniz
Ah, yes, support for unanimity is essential for all decision functions.
\stop

\startvoltaire
And if our decision function is strategy-proof, then there should be no
incentive for any representative to withhold their true preferences.
\stop

\startleibniz
That is correct.
\stop

\startvoltaire
So then, say, if representative one were to change their preference for C, it
should therefore not be to their detriment to increase their ranking of C
over B.

In other words, the outcome should remain A since if this edit changed the
outcome, then representative one would not be incentivized to report their true
preference since A is of a higher rank than either B or C.

Yes, correct.

GENTLEMEN! ORDER! The nominal call shall proceed without modification.

\startvoltaire
However, the case would certainly be different should representative one modify
their preference for A relative to either B or C, correct?
\stop

\startleibniz
Yes. Since we are assuming an arbitrary decision function, we can't assume that
lowering the rank of A for any representative will preserve the outcome we
obtained by unanimity.
\stop

\startvoltaire
But we do know that representative one cannot be punished for reporting an
increased preference for C.

We don't know whether it will be certain to modify the outcome, but we do know
that if it did, the outcome could only be C.

The outcome is now ambiguous, but it is true that we know that no

Otherwise, representative one would not be incentivized to report their
preference for C.

An outcome of B would be like Marie Antoinette swapping her preference to
chocolate cake when presented an irrelevant alternative.
\stop

\startleibniz
As an analogy, but not as a formal argument.

Indeed, I now wish to argue this: that we may now repeat this procedure for

I vote death. {\emph Immediate} death. Let the tyrant carry his head to the
scaffold.
\stop

\startleibniz
How would you perform this algorithm?
\stop

\startvoltaire
Simple. We proceed conditionally on whether the outcome is changed by the
increase in C over A.

If the outcome remains the same, then we continue to perform the same
operations, following the same reasoning already demonstrated, on
representative two.

Then, if the procedure again fails to change the outcome, we continue to
representative three, and then so on.

If, at any point, the outcome is changed to C, we shall halt on the
representative responsible for it.
\stop

\startleibniz
Ah! I see your reasoning. This algorithm is sure to terminate by unanimity.

For in the worst case, you would modify the preference of representative
seven-hundred forty-five, and by then the choice of C will be placed at the top
of every ranking.

By unanimity, the outcome must be C in such a case.
\stop

\startvoltaire
That's my thinking.

Therefore, there must exist a representative where performing this procedure
does indeed change the outcome from A to C, and at this point we halt the
algorithm.

I decided that \louis was guilty, thus I open the penal code to see that the
penalty is death.

I, therefore, pronounce death upon him, but do so with the restriction proposed
by \mailhe.
\stop

\startvoltaire
Given now that we know the existence of a representative where, upon lifting
their rank for C, would change the outcome to C, we shall call this
representative the pivotal voter.

I will label the index of the pivotal voter's location with the letter N.

Now, I'd like to apply a new algorithm to this second table - the one taking
place after C has been lifted.

Notice that the representatives to the right of the pivotal voter already list
C at the bottom of their preferences.

Therefore, changing their preference for B and lifting it above A should
not change the outcome.

So, here we reach a key moment of my argument - it is essential in order to

I would like to argue that if the pivotal voter swaps their preferences of A
and C in this second table, then the outcome will change to A.

Hold on, \voltaire! You can't make such a leap in logic. You have modified the
rank of A in many positions, so there is no guarantee that this pivotal voter
has the same influence they once did following your first algorithm.

Indeed. But you must confess that we still know that such a change will either
do nothing, or it will change the outcome to A.

Let's consider the case where the outcome remains C.

Then observe that, if this were the case, we would then be allowed to lift
every A to the left and right of the pivotal voter.

If we did this, we would be able to construct the exact table as the one
immediately prior to the change induced by the pivotal voter, where - you would
recall - we observed that the outcome was A.
