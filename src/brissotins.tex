\scene

\open Spring 1792. The home of \vergniaud. The \brissotin[party] have gathered
for dinner.

\startvergniaud
So, what will it be tonight? What are you fiends in the appetite for?
\stop

\stage \brissot is lost in contemplation.

\startsplit

\startguadet
Give us \marat!
\stop

\split
\leavevmode

\startisnard
No! No! \condorcet!
\stop

\stopsplit

\startvergniaud
No. I can't stand doing \marat. Even in jest he gives me a migraine.
\stop

\startsplit

\startguadet
Oh, don't be such a stooge!
\stop

\split

\startgensonne
\robespierre!
\stop

\stopsplit

\startvergniaud
\robespierre? Ah, a classic!
\stop

\stage \vergniaud switches his posture to that of a predator as he cartoonishly
stalks the other \brissotins like prey.

\stage Pause. Silence. Minus a few chuckles.

\startvergniaud
To arms? What's this business of arms? Whose arms? How many arms?

What do these arms do? And why?
\stop

\stage Laughter. \vergniaud remains deadly serious.

\startvergniaud
Consider, citizens, the arms of our enemies.

They must have two for every soldier, but how do we know they don't possess
more?

\(beat)
The Romans had arms, yet consider their fate and ask yourselves whether our
arms should truly fare any better?

With my anxious glare, the arms I see are only suited for gorging on bread and
composing pornography.

\(beat)
I assure you, citizens, that if I were the master of all the arms in France, I
would have long ago formed them into a giant arm-monster capable of devouring
any who stand opposed to virtue.
\stop

\stage Laughter. \vergniaud joins in this time.

\startguadet
Oh, come now, \brissot.

Don't tell me you're too bitter about your spat with \robespierre to laugh at
his expense!
\stop

\startbrissot
No, gentlemen. I'm only thinking.
\stop

\startvergniaud
My friend, in the time I've known you, not once have I seen you take a break
from thinking.
\stop

\startbrissot
\(chuckles)
I suppose that's true, \vergniaud. Must be \condorcet's influence on me!
\stop

\stage Laughter.

\startbrissot
But, no. I contemplate grim observations that I've made of the assembly.
\stop

\startguadet
You've only now begun to notice? You're a bit slow if that's the case, I'm
afraid.
\stop

\startgensonne
He's just bitter about losing the election for president again!
\stop

\startbrissot
I suppose you could say that, though my bitterness is not selfish, I assure
you.

All that matters is your own victory, \gensonne.

I am honored to be merely a supporter.
\stop

\stage \brissot stands up to begin pacing the dining room.

\startbrissot
Nonetheless, I find that losing the election for president by such a narrow
margin - by the {\emph same} margin - for each of the nine ballots that bore my
name...

I believe this is a symptom of a larger issue.
\stop

\startguadet
Well, get on. What's this about?
\stop

\startbrissot
I fear that the assembly has fully embraced factionalism.

It's clear to me that royalists have successfully formed a conservative party
to oppose our agenda and collude with the crown.
\stop

\stage The \brissotins exchange stern glances.

\startbrissot
I say, gentlemen, that if we are up against collusion, then we have no choice
but to respond in kind.
\stop

\startisnard
I won't debase myself by submitting to factionalism!
\stop

\startbrissot
I commend your principles, my friend.

I, too, feel disgusted with the mere thought of it.

But forcing the court to declare war will be impossible while the conservatives
gather influence below the noses of the sane.
\stop

\startvergniaud
If I may be so bold, I believe your grievances are overblown, \brissot.
\stop

\startbrissot
How so?
\stop

\startvergniaud
We have the support of the public. The people of France are unified in their
desire for war. No collusion can penetrate this fact.
\stop

\startbrissot
Perhaps you have a point...
\stop

\startgensonne
But what of \robespierre?
\stop

\startvergniaud
What of him?
\stop

\startbrissot
No. \robespierre is my own burden to bear.

The feud between he and I is personal, and I'm confident that the public
understands this.
\stop

\startisnard
How can you be sure? \robespierre has effectively declared himself the king of
the Jacobins.
\stop

\startguadet
Doubtless \robespierre will stop at nothing to declare himself the king of the
French.
\stop

\stage The \brissotins grumble at the thought.

\startbrissot
Sadly, I agree. \robespierre thinks he alone speaks with the voice of the
people.

What ego. What insufferable ego.
\stop

\startisnard
Here, here!
\stop

\startbrissot
But he is not a legitimate threat to us.

Gentlemen... we are the ones in power, not him. Let us not forget this.
\stop

\startvergniaud
Then what say you? What's our next step?
\stop

\startbrissot
I believe you yourself are equipped with the answer to that, \vergniaud.
\stop

\startvergniaud
True. I just wanted to hear you confirm it.
\stop

\startgensonne
What's this?
\stop

\startbrissot
\gensonne, do you believe your position as president is strong enough to call
on the king to declare war by the end of this month?
\stop

\startgensonne
You must be joking.
\stop

\startvergniaud
After I've given my speech on the matter?
\stop

\startgensonne
Truly? You have a speech prepared, \vergniaud?
\stop

\startvergniaud
My finest work, if I may boast.
\stop

\startgensonne
Perhaps... well, perhaps then I could make it work.

Assuming of course you perform a miracle on the tribune.
\stop

\startbrissot
Then, gentlemen, I say we should all begin preparations!
\stop

\startvergniaud
To arms! To arms!
\stop

\startbrissotins
To arms! To arms!
\stop

\stage The \brissotins applaud themselves.
