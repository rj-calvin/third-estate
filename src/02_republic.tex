\open \condorcet has begun ignoring the ongoing discussion.

\stage Enter \voltaire.

\startvoltaire
Republic, republic! What even is a republic?
\stop

\stage Enter \leibniz.

\startleibniz
Ah! The answer is simple! A republic is a category of monad!
\stop

\startvoltaire
Oh, professor \leibniz. Whatever shall we do with you?
\stop

\startleibniz
Erm, perhaps more clarity shall repair my rhetoric.
\stop

\goodbreak
\stage \leibniz prepares a blackboard:

\startleibniz[continued]
You see, dear \voltaire, a republic is a particular kind of monad that is
equipped with a decision function that aggregates the preferences of a
collection of members, deputies, jurors, citizens, what have you!

This way, the qualities that one observes of this monad represent a consensus
derived from the given collection and is contingent on the choice of decision
function.

These qualities thus allows the many to speak as one!

How exciting!
\stop

\startvoltaire
To those who maintain their sanity, a republic may be better described as a
government operated by elected representatives.
\stop

\startleibniz
But the election of representatives is simply a particular choice of decision
function! Observe:

\goodbreak
\stage The blackboard presents:

\startleibniz[continued]
We can conceptualize the election of representatives as a decision function
composed of two parts.

The first selects a partition of our assembly and allows members of one group
to rank their preferences for members belonging to the other.

The second part allows these selected representatives to then aggregate their
preferences based on the ranking given to them by their constituency.
\stop

\startvoltaire
And if all the representatives were to die without warning? What should be done
then?
\stop

\startleibniz
You misunderstand. I speak about an abstraction.
\stop

\startvoltaire
Correct. Now answer me.
\stop

\startleibniz
I'm not sure. I haven't yet considered.
\stop

\startvoltaire
I repeat, "whatever shall we do with you?"
\stop

\startleibniz
I fail to see how ignorance implies incompetence.
\stop

\startvoltaire
You fail to see many things.

Your incessant calculations keep you blind.

\(beat)
You see, professor, I see into the future. Behold!

% TODO: imagery of the street.

I feel now the brisk winter cold filter through my fabrics as I approach the
new church of humanity.

A dilapidated construction that slumps to one side, the building I see is a
relic of the Ancien R\'egime.

And now, just as then, it is the object worshipped by fools who fear the
responsibilities of god.

\(beat)
If I were a good man, the sight of this pile of warped lumber would compel me
to suicide, but I am not a good man - I am merely man.

I know that housed within this structure are the seats that have fractured and
divided absolute power;

thus, despite my shivering, I am compelled to gawk at this image of the whole -
this image of the spoils that one man is to gain from the lottery.

\(beat)
And it is here I stand, basking in this divine imagination, where my body is
warmed by the blood that rushes to my member.

Here I stand, member in hand, members passing by, where I cry, "republic,
republic! I, the people, worship you!"
\stop

\startleibniz
There is no victory in the republic. The division of power is maintained by our
shared reason.
\stop

\startvoltaire
Ha! Because, surely, any republic must necessarily be the best of all possible
republics.
\stop

\startleibniz
It will necessarily be the only one we are ready for.
\stop

\startvoltaire
Who's to say that we are ready?
