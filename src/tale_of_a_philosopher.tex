\scene

\open The \vernet residence living room.

\stage Enter \vernet.

\stage She sets the table with a breakfast consisting of coffee and an
omelette.

\stage Enter \eliza.

\startvernet
Good evening, dear! I've prepared you breakfast!
\stop

\starteliza
It's near daybreak.
\stop

\startvernet
You're mistaken, it's near sunset.
\stop

\startvernet
Dear, you look like you are still living in yesterday.

I can see it in your sunken eyes.

\beat

Oh! What am I saying.

\beat{embraces \eliza}

I shouldn't make such comments about a woman's appearance.

I apologize, darling. I made you breakfast.
\stop

\stage \eliza seats herself.

\starteliza
This omelette is enormous. How many eggs did you put in it?
\stop

\startvernet
Twelve.
\stop

\starteliza
What? Twelve?

\beat{chuckles}

My attention must be worth a fortune.
\stop

\startvernet
It is to me, dear. Even if through such tired eyes.
\stop

\stage \eliza begins her meal by taking a sip of coffee.

\startvernet
I wish to apologize.
\stop

\starteliza
Again? It was an astute observation the first time.
\stop

\startvernet
For my mood at where we had left off in my tale.
\stop

\starteliza
Oh.
\stop

\startvernet
I have reflected on this matter and have decided that its cause was a selfish
desire to acquire knowledge that is forbidden to me.

Please understand, dear: I am an old woman.

Many of my days are occupied in my fantasy of completing the stories most dear
to my heart.

Thus, I reacted with hostility when your story failed to live up to these
expectations.

\beat

I apologize, dear.
\stop

\stage \eliza smiles.

\stage \vernet smiles, then takes a seat. She begins stuffing a pipe with
tobacco.

\starteliza
Please, madame. I don't mind displays of passion when they are honest.

In fact, I hope to experience whatever passions remain from your story~-
incomplete as it may be.
\stop

\startvernet
\beat{while lighting her pipe}

Oh, yes, dear. You have a debt to me.
\stop

\stage \vernet chuckles, puffing up the room with smoke signals.

\startvernet
When your mother first introduced herself to me, and informed me of her
objective, I was convinced that the only reasonable cure your mother could of
had in mind was a night of passion.

\beat{puff}

Thus~- O, woe! I become swept in a frivolous passion for respecting the privacy
of these lovers!

At once, I compel \marcoz, \sarret, and myself to banish ourselves until
sunrise.

What foolishness...
\stop

\starteliza
So you asked for details once~--?
\stop

\startvernet
-- Don't interrupt, darling.

I am an oracle~- I speak on behalf of the Parcae as they twine the thread of
life.
\stop

\starteliza
\beat{chuckles}

As you say, madame.
\stop

\startvernet
When we return in the morning, the three of us are shocked to see this living
room covered in pamphlets!

Your father, sprawled along his doodles like a schoolboy, explains that your
mother had left prior to dawn to satisfy an alibi come daybreak.

He then proudly proclaims to have discovered the existence of what he calls a
universal calculus;

insisting that such a calculus is powerful enough to represent any thought
reachable through reason, and that it was necessary that this discovery be
preserved for the pursuit of human progress.

\beat{puff}

I am astonished.

\beat{puff}

"Dear, lord," I think.

"Dear, lord. When the woman meant reason, she meant {\emph arithmetic}!"

\beat

He then assures us that the discovery itself is secondary to the importance of
properly introducing such a new idea to the public.

He says your mother explained that {\emph how} an idea is presented can be just
as meaningful as {\emph what} is presented.

So, he announces that by spring he shall have written his great tableau of
human history.

The magnum opus for which he plans to prove that the flow of human progress is
not random, but is instead driven by the perfectibility of reason, science, and
education.

\beat

Doubtless, you have read some of this tableau last night.
\stop

\starteliza
Actually, I have been reading letters first.
\stop

\startvernet
Darling, it takes effort to pluck a page at random and find anything not
belonging to his tableau.
\stop

\starteliza
What are you accusing me of?
\stop

\startvernet
Did you not so much as glance at how the ink sings and flows on the page?

You sorted them, yet failed to parse even a single phrase long enough to notice
the joy of its prose?
\stop

\starteliza
I sorted them by page number.
\stop

\stage \vernet snobbishly pouts, then stands to fetch more tobacco from a
nearby tin.

\starteliza
You scoff? I fail to see the crime in reading chronologically.
\stop

\startvernet
Oh, I accuse you of nothing, dear.

I simply don't believe you.
\stop

\stage \vernet reignites her pipe~- another round of puffs as she returns to
her seat.

\startvernet
In fact, I say it's adorable that you mention this.

You see, your mother wasn't the only visitor your father had during his time
writing his tableau.

\beat{puff}

Your father had the pleasure of teaching you to count!

O, you were such a little angel!

O, I remember that stunned face you had when you first recognized your father
through that terrible beard he had grown!
\stop

\starteliza
Yes, my mother told me of this.
\stop

\startvernet
But you don't remember?
\stop

\starteliza
I remember how to count.
\stop

\stage \vernet considers this solemnly.

\starteliza
And have retained a long-felt repulsion for beards.
\stop

\startvernet
\beat{puff}

Mm. Good girl.

\beat{puff}

You came to visit me just prior to the harsh winter of seventeen ninety-four.

O, the war had devoured everything and the weather pronounced many dead to
hunger.

Firewood had become rare.

\beat

Your mother writes during this time that she sustains the family by trading for
beans and lentils.

\cabanis, on occasion, comes to visit with prescriptions for your father's
worsening leg~- injured, no doubt, by all that sitting.
\stop

\stage \vernet stands and breaks away~- clearly a dramatic moment in her story.

\startvernet
I become suspect of an enemy within.

The physician, your uncle, \cabanis.

\beat

\cabanis has been known to provide herbs for those seeking to take death by
their own hand.

I worry that your father intends to make himself a martyr.

The fates, however, inform me that his time could not come by his own hand
unless he has first completed his great tableau.

\beat

One afternoon, as I watch him write, I wonder: how is it possible for such
lifted spirits to endure when fear has become the law of the day?

And so, I ask him this: "\condorcet, where are you in your story?"

Your father says, and I apologize, dear:

\beat{imitating \condorcet}

"At this epoch of the story, I have begun my final treatise on the future
Atlantis!"

\beat{puff}

I take this to mean he is almost finished. This is terrible news to me.

\beat

He then begins jabbering about how the printing press will eventually become
perfected and how future conflicts can be resolved by constructing laws from
the laws we discover from nature.

He talks of a society formed through an Earth-spanning network of encyclopedias
where all entries are written using a universal language.

\beat{puff}

One that isn't Latin, of course.

\beat

And... as I watch him bounce to the rhythm of his words...

I ask myself: what does a man who can write for two seasons on end do when he
concludes his great work?

\beat

He claims to have already invented the universal language of science, so what
else is there for him to invent next?

What will remain to satisfy him if he were to remain entrapped within my home?

\beat

Thus, I devise a scheme to guarantee his life until spring.

I tell him: "\condorcet, you should divorce your wife."

\beat{puff}

Instantly, he is convinced of it. Says it's a brilliant idea.

\beat

To protect your estate, you see?
\stop

\starteliza
Yeah, I see.
\stop

\startvernet
Take it from a widow, darling. Never has there been a more free way for a woman
to live!
\stop

\starteliza
Still no.
\stop

\stage \vernet laughs as she returns to her seat.
