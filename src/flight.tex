\scene

\open Paris, Summer 1791. \condorcet is reading the daily broadsheets.

\stage Enter \voltaire.

\startvoltaire
Traveling across northern France, a man beset by the weight of the world and
the weight of his fat watches westward through the window of his carriage as
the sun proceeds to set over the farmland just beyond the border of Varennes.

While the six horses ahead of him trot onward, he watches the hypnotic parallax
of the wheat field with a wistful satisfaction.

\(beat)
"If only we just had more of these," he thinks to himself.

"France could really use more of these."

\(beat)
The man's eyes soon become bewitched with visions of working the land: he
pictures himself tilling the soil, scattering the seeds, harvesting the yield,
or whatever it is those people do all day.

And in this moment, with the smell of manure painting the scene against the
dwindling sunset, he feels an irresistible kinship with such an image.

As if it was by some cruel twist of fate that his heritage had somehow robbed
him of his chance to realize his true self.

\(beat)
Yet, he smiles. Because, for the first time, he allows the limits of his
imagination to finally brush against the boundary of a life as it was always
meant to be in the best of all possible worlds.

\(beat)
A world without words.

A world without errors.

A world without uncertainty...

\(beat)
... barring the weather.

\stage Exit \voltaire.

\direction The singing of La Prise de La Bastille is heard from another room.
An infant begins to cry as a cradle is revealed.

\stage \condorcet puts down the broadsheet and attends to the cradle to lift an
infant into his arms.

\direction \condorcet speaks with a shrill voice.

\startcondorcet
Has the revelry woken you, dear \eliza?

\(beat)
I understand. You don't yet understand the joys of pride that compels us to
sing for our nation.

As your mother would say, you are just now beginning to learn the pain of
being separated from your nurse and the joy of being reunited.

\(beat)
I'm happy to oblige.
\stop

\direction The singing comes to an end.

\startcondorcet[continued]
Ah, perhaps a story will bore you back to sleep!
